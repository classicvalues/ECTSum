Greetings, and welcome to the Americold Realty Trust Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this
conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Scott Henderson. Please go ahead.
 
Scott Henderson
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Senior VP of Capital Markets, Treasury & IR
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Americold Realty Trust Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. In addition to
the press release distributed this afternoon, we have filed a supplemental package with additional detail on our results, which is

Americold's Chief Executive Officer; George Chappelle; Chief Commercial Officer; Rob Chambers; and Chief Financial Officer, Marc
Smernoff. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open up the call to your questions.
On today's call, management's prepared remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements address
matters that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those discussed today. A number of factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations,
assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to us at this time, speak only as of the date they are made, and management
undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including core EBITDA and AFFO. Full definitions of these
non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures are contained in the supplemental
information package available on the company's website.
Now I will turn the call over to George.
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Thank you, Scott, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. This afternoon, I will provide an update on our 4
near-term priorities and summarize our financial and operating results. I will then comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Rob will provide an update on our recent customer initiatives, and Marc will provide an update on our investment in capital markets
activity, along with a detailed walk-through of our guidance for the remainder of the year.
Turning to our 4 near-term priorities. First, we continue to demonstrate we can reprice our warehouse business to offset inflationary
pressures in our cost structure and protect margin dollars. For the third quarter, rent and storage revenue per economic occupied pallet
in our same store on a constant currency basis increased by 8.1% versus the prior year's quarter. Service revenue per throughput pallet
increased by 7.7%. As a reminder, some of these price increases were implemented during the third quarter, meaning the full run rate
will not be seen until fourth quarter results.
During the third quarter, the majority of the inflationary pressures were in power costs, property taxes and warehouse supplies costs. We
have implemented additional targeted pricing and power surcharge initiatives to address this known inflation, and we will exit the fourth
quarter at a run rate covering all known inflation incurred through the third quarter. Moving through the fourth quarter, we expect the
majority of the inflationary pressures to continue to be primarily in power costs, particularly in our international markets and in
warehouse supplies costs. As such, we will continue to revisit our pricing and power surcharge initiatives. Please note that at this time
and based on current market conditions, we do not anticipate significant moves in our labor costs going forward.
As a result of our pricing initiatives, we are pleased to see progress in the recovery of our global same-store warehouse NOI margin,
which for the quarter was 29.4%. This was an increase of 125 basis points, driven by an improvement in services NOI margin, which
increased 116 basis points from the prior year on a constant currency basis.
Second, we are focused on differentiating our platform by providing best-in-class customer service. We are beginning to see a positive
shift in our customer service levels with the increase in our perm-to-temp ratio, which I will discuss momentarily. As we expected, our
service levels are improving as our newer associates get more familiar with the Americold operating system and our workforce ratio
improves. We expect this trend to continue with our efforts to reduce turnover. I firmly believe that servicing our customers at
best-in-class levels will ultimately lead to increased market share and has meaningfully contributed to our recent increase in occupancy.
Third, we continue to focus on labor management with the goal of optimizing our mix of permanent and temporary associates in our
facilities while also reducing our turnover rate. As we have mentioned in previous calls, temporary associates cost more per labor hour
and are less productive than permanent Americold associates. Higher turnover is also costly and drives inefficiencies in our business.
During the third quarter, we are very pleased to have achieved a perm-to-temp hours ratio of 72-28. This is 10 points higher than our
third quarter 2021 levels and slightly better than our pre-COVID levels of 70-30. We are making progress toward our longer-term goal of
achieving a consistent 80-20 ratio. Our turnover rate is still significantly elevated when compared to both last year and pre-COVID levels.
We ended September this year at an annualized turnover trend approximately 21 percentage points higher than that of September 2021.
Compared to 2019, a pre-COVID year, we were approximately 33 percentage points higher. A stable, well-trained workforce is critical to
operating efficiently and returning to pre-COVID margins in our warehouse services business.
Our final focus area is ensuring that our development projects are delivered on time and on budget and then deliver the underwritten
returns. This quarter, we are pleased to announce that we have completed our projects in Dublin, Ireland; in Barcelona, Spain; and we
are currently inbounding our customers' products into both of these facilities. We expect these projects to stabilize during the time
frames and at the return levels disclosed.
Turning to our third quarter results. AFFO per share was $0.29, an increase of 7.4% compared to prior year. This performance was
principally driven by our Global Warehouse same-store pool, which generated total revenue growth of 9.6% and NOI growth of 14.4%,
both on a constant currency basis. The same-store revenue and NOI growth was a result of our pricing initiatives combined with a 437
basis point increase in economic occupancy over the third quarter 2021, partially offset by declining throughput volumes of 1.3%.
On the cost side, the majority of inflation continues to be in our power and warehouse supplies cost. In certain markets, we have also
seen larger increases in property taxes. Additionally, while our associate turnover ratio remains significantly elevated, which negatively
impacts our productivity inefficiency, we did see improvement in our same-store warehouse services NOI margin primarily driven by our
pricing initiatives. On the whole, in the same-store pool, we were able to drive NOI growth higher through a combination of, first, higher
pricing across our warehouse business to overcome increasing costs; and second, increased economic occupancy, which is very accretive
to our bottom line.
Now let me comment on a specific customer agreement within our third-party managed segment, which, as a reminder, is a segment
that generates approximately 2% of Americold's total company NOI. After a strategic review of this part of our business, we have made
the decision to exit a relationship with a national retailer for whom we manage 4 facilities and have no ownership in the land, buildings,
equipment or any other assets. This management agreement generates approximately 1% of Americold's total company NOI. The
operations for this retailer consume a vast amount of time and energy for little economic benefit. Of Americold's 16,000-plus associates,
approximately 2,500 or 16% of our company's associate base is dedicated to this retailer's business.
To put this in context, 16% of our associates support 1% of our total company NOI. On or around December 1, we are ending our
management agreement with this retailer and are in the process of transitioning the business and associates to new third-party service
providers. This will enable us to focus our attention on labor management in our core warehouse business, where we own, operate and
utilize our assets to create value for our customers and shareholders and where we generate approximately 92% of Americold's total
company NOI.
On an annual basis, this agreement with this retailer contributes approximately $300 million in revenue and $8 million in NOI to
Americold. This equates to a 2.7% NOI margin, the lowest margin business we have in our company. And in fact, the total company NOI
margin increases by 235 basis points when we exit this business.
This $8 million in annual NOI translates to approximately $0.03 per share in annual AFFO. We do not expect any material impact in this
fiscal year. The remaining businesses in the managed segment adds value to our company and shareholders, and we have no plans at
this time to exit what remains.
As a result of the progress we have made in our operations, combined with the recovering global food supply chain, we are increasing our
full year 2022 AFFO per share guidance to the range of $1.08 to $1.12. Marc will provide commentary around the individual components.
Despite no shortage of macro headwinds, high inflation, a challenging labor market, continued disruption in the global supply chain and
increasing base interest rates, to name a few, we are very pleased with our progress year-to-date and expect continued operational
improvement for the rest of the year. We are deeply committed to providing best-in-class customer service, and the results show up in
our incremental occupancy improvement throughout the year. We continue to be laser focused on our pricing initiatives to cover known
inflation.
As it relates to our cost structure, we have added target controls, created more robust processes and strengthened our team to ensure
that we have an accurate timely view of each cost component. In short, we are a better operating company today than we were 1 year
ago.
Lastly, before I hand it over to Rob, let me comment on our ESG initiatives, which is a key priority for us here at Americold. I am happy to
report we recently received our 2022 GRESB score of 75, which is an improvement of 12 points versus last year's score. Additionally,
against our peer set, we also improved our rank to second versus third last year. We are very pleased with this outcome and look forward
to continued progress in our ESG journey. One example of this continued progress is our recently completed refinance of our senior
unsecured credit facility. In this refinance, we incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component tied to our annual GRESB rating.
With that, I will turn it over to Rob.
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
Thank you, George. For the third quarter, we are pleased to report total company revenue and NOI growth of 7% and 16%, respectively,
driven by our warehouse business. We are seeing positive results in the top line fundamentals in our warehouse business across both
food manufacturers and retailers. These improved fundamentals, combined with an intense focus on customer service, are leading to an
enhanced win rate on our new business development opportunities and driving higher occupancy. I cannot underscore enough the
importance of our customer service initiatives, which are helping drive our incremental occupancy gains.
As we have discussed on previous calls, we will continue our pricing initiatives within our Global Warehouse business in order to address
known cost increases from inflation. We have taken multiple pricing actions over the past 12-plus months, and these actions are
protecting our margin dollars. As George mentioned, we successfully exited the third quarter with price increases in place in order to
cover known inflation from the second quarter. Some of these increases were implemented during the third quarter, meaning the full run
rate will not be seen until fourth quarter results. Conversations with our customers continue to be productive around our pricing
initiatives. We are being very targeted and data-driven in our approach. As a result, we continue to demonstrate Americold's ability to
protect margin dollars through pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures.
As we have discussed previously, the path to achieving pre-COVID same-store NOI margin levels consist of the following 5 prerequisites.
First, we need to continue our pricing initiatives to offset inflation. Second, we need to continue to integrate and fully commercialize
recently acquired facilities. Third, we must achieve and stabilize the proper mix of perm-to-temp hours ratio and reduce our turnover to
normalized levels. Fourth, we need occupancy to continue to recover and stabilize to pre-COVID levels. And finally, we need throughput
volume to recover. We are at various stages of progress across these 5 prerequisites and are working diligently to improve in these areas.
On to our commercialization efforts. At quarter end, within our Global Warehouse segment, rent and storage revenue from fixed
commitment contracts increased on an absolute dollar basis to $396 million compared to $346 million at the end of the third quarter of
2021. On a combined pro forma basis, we derived 40.9% of rent and storage revenue from fixed commitment storage contracts.
Enhanced commercialization, which includes our fixed commitment initiatives, is a critical component of our strategy. We look forward to
continuing to improve this metric.
Within our Global Warehouse segment, we had no material changes to the composition of our top 25 customers who account for
approximately 48% of our Global Warehouse revenue on a pro forma basis. Additionally, our churn rate remained low at approximately
3.2% of total warehouse revenues, consistent with historical churn rates.
Turning to development. We are very pleased to announce that we recently opened 2 new facilities, 1 in Dublin, Ireland and 1 in
Barcelona, Spain. The Dublin facility is the greenfield build at a 6.3 million cubic feet and 20,000 pallet positions. This building brings
much needed capacity to a key market for Americold and was designed with features and technology to support the demand in this
market including blast freezing, mobile racking and conveyor systems. The facility is approximately 50% presold and is expected to ramp
to full occupancy by the second half of next year, supporting customers in our retail and dairy sectors.
Our Barcelona facility is an expansion project on land already owned by Americold that adds 3.3 million cubic feet and 12,000 pallet
positions into a critical distribution market. This expansion is conventional in nature and will offer storage capacity across multiple
temperature zones. This expansion is part of a campus optimization project. It also included adding blast capacity to our existing
Barcelona site to further support growth in the protein market.
We look forward to multiple development deliveries in the coming quarters as outlined in our financial supplement. It should be noted,
however, that we continue to experience disruption within the global supply chain as it relates to automation components and other
parts. Please note that in addition to these disruptions, the elevated cost of construction is pressuring the business case for potential new
development starts. Despite these challenges, Americold is committed to adding best-in-class capacity around the globe to support our
customers' growth, and our pipeline for new potential projects remains robust.
Lastly, I want to thank all of our Americold associates who are working hard every day during this quarter, our busiest time of the year, to
ensure that we are playing our part in getting food through the supply chain and available for families as we gather for the holiday
season. We are encouraged by the growth we've experienced in our occupancy across our portfolio, and it is a direct reflection of the
great work of our associates, the innovation of our solutions and the criticality of our infrastructure. We thank our customers for their
partnership and the opportunity to fulfill our mission of helping our customers feed the world.
Now I'll turn it over to Marc.
 
Marc Jason Smernoff
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Executive VP
Thank you, Rob. Today, I will discuss our investment in capital markets activity and then turn to full year guidance. Regarding our recent
investment activity, we closed on our Australian acquisition for approximately AUD 25 million on July 1 and closed on our New Zealand
lease buyout and renovation for approximately NZD 18 million on August 1. Both of these investments were funded using a combination
of cash and our multicurrency revolver. Additionally, in September, as planned, we exited a leased building in Brisbane, Australia that
came with our acquisition of Lago Cold store. At the time of the acquisition, we planned to consolidate business from the lease facility
into our owned infrastructure.
Now turning to our capital markets activity. During the quarter, we closed on the upsize and extension of our new $2 billion
sustainability-linked senior unsecured credit facilities. We subsequently entered into interest rate swaps to fix a significant portion of the
base rates for these facilities. As part of this refinancing, we raised an unsecured term loan that we funded on November 1 to pay off $264
million of secured CMBS debt. These transactions enabled us to: increase our liquidity by $200 million by upsizing our U.S. dollar term
loan; extend our overall debt duration with no real estate debt maturities until 2026; pay off our CMBS debt, reducing the corresponding
interest rate from a fixed 5.7% rate to a fixed 4.1% rate and transitioning our capital structure to almost all unsecured debt; reduce our
floating rate debt exposure from 30% of total debt at the end of the second quarter of 2022 to 20% at the end of the third quarter of
2022; and incorporate an ESG component, which results in a 1 basis point interest rate reduction if our GRESB score improves by 5% or
more next year.
At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $3.2 billion. We had total liquidity of $700 million consisting of cash on hand and revolver
availability. Our net debt to pro forma core EBITDA was approximately 6.5x. At this point, we have invested approximately $480 million
on development projects in process, which reflects almost 1 turn of leverage. We have approximately $111 million remaining to invest in
announced in-process development projects over the next 15 months.
Now let me discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As George mentioned, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2022 AFFO
per share to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12. Please see Page 44 of the IR supplemental for the individual components.
At this point, I will comment on the primary building blocks to get to AFFO per share and provide a bridge for each as it relates to the full
year. Please note the comparisons described represent comparisons to corresponding prior year results. For the full year, we are now
expecting constant currency revenue growth in the same store to be in the range of 7.5% to 8%. Year-to-date through the third quarter,
we are at 7.9% growth.
Let me provide more detail around the key revenue components. For occupancy and throughput volumes, for the full year, we expect
economic occupancy to increase by approximately 275 to 300 basis points. Year-to-date, it increased by 249 basis points. This implies
economic occupancy increases in the fourth quarter by approximately 350 to 450 basis points as we expect food manufacturers to
continue to ramp up production. For the full year, we expect throughput volumes to decrease by 1.3% to 1.5%. Year-to-date, they
decreased by 1.1%. This implies throughput volume decreases in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.9% to 2.7%.
For pricing, for the full year, we expect constant currency rent and storage revenue for economic occupied pallet growth in the low 7s to
mid-7s percent. Year-to-date, it increased by 6.8%. This implies growth in the fourth quarter to be in the low 8s to mid-8s percent as we
continue our pricing and power surcharge initiatives to cover known inflation, which is being driven primarily by power costs within the
rent and storage business of our same store.
For the full year, we expect constant currency service revenue per throughput pallet growth in the high 6s to low 7s percent.
Year-to-date, it increased by 7.3%. This implies growth in the fourth quarter to be in the high 4s to low 6s percent.
As you may recall, last year in the fourth quarter 2021, we started taking additional pricing in our services business due to inflationary
pressures, mostly in labor costs. This creates a tougher year-over-year comp in the fourth quarter for our services revenue pricing metrics.
As George mentioned earlier, while we are not seeing significant moves in our labor cost at this time, we continue to see inflationary
pressures in warehouse supplies costs. We continue to implement our pricing initiatives accordingly.
For the full year, we are now expecting same-store constant currency NOI growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%. Year-to-date, we're at
4.4% growth. This implies growth in the fourth quarter to be in the range of low double-digit percent to mid-teens percent. This implies
fourth quarter increase is being driven by our expectation of continued increases in pricing and occupancy.
On to other line items that I will be describing in actual dollars, not on a constant currency basis. Turning to the non-same-store pool. At
this time, we are pushing back the completion date by 1 quarter to the first quarter of 2023 of our customer-dedicated automated site in
Pennsylvania. The facility is complete, and we have received a certificate of occupancy. However, in consultation with our customer, given
the high level of volume this particular customer experiences during the holiday season, we felt it was prudent to take this approach. We
did not want to begin the onboarding process during this crucial time. We look forward to starting the process with this customer early
next year. Please note, while this does impact the performance of our non-same-store pool in the fourth quarter, we still expect this
project to ramp and stabilize during the time frame and at the return level disclosed.
For the full year, we expect the non-same-store pool to generate approximately $34 million to $38 million of NOI, which is net of
approximately $14 million of start-up costs related to our development projects. Year-to-date, these start-up costs have been
approximately $8.5 million. The start-up cost number has increased primarily due to the change in the completion date for this
Pennsylvania project.
Turning to our managed and transportation segments NOI. For the full year, we expect these segments combined to generate
approximately $57 million to $60 million. Year-to-date, these segments combined have generated $44 million of NOI. This range
incorporates the exit of the managed business of the national retailer's 4 facilities that George covered earlier.
Turning to our core SG&A expense. Adding back stock compensation expense to our total SG&A expense arrives at what we call a core
SG&A expense, which is what truly impacts AFFO. For the full year, we expect core SG&A expense to be approximately $200 million to
$204 million. Year-to-date, it was $149 million.
Turning to interest expense. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $114 million to $115 million. Year-to-date
interest expense was $83 million. This range implies interest expense of approximately $31 million to $32 million for the fourth quarter.
This slight increase versus $30 million in the third quarter of 2022 is being driven by the increase in base rates for our credit facilities
partially offset by the actions we took during the quarter to convert floating rate debt to fixed and paying off CMBS debt with less
expensive fixed rate unsecured term loan debt.
On to our cash tax expense, which is the number that impacts AFFO. For the full year, we expect this expense to be approximately $4
million to $6 million. Year-to-date, it was $3 million. As a reminder, most of the corporate income taxes we pay at Americold are from our
international operations.
Turning to our maintenance CapEx. For the full year, we expect the investments to be approximately $84 million to $86 million.
Year-to-date, it was $59 million. This implies maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $25 million to $27 million in the fourth
quarter. Please note, this implies a meaningfully higher number in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus last year's fourth quarter, which was
$21 million. At the AFFO per share level, year-to-date, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.01 and for the
third quarter, approximately $0.0025 due to the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Broadly speaking, as our
guidance page of the IR supplemental shows, we expect continued currency translation headwinds due to the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar for the remainder of the year.
Turning to the full year AFFO per share. For the full year, we are increasing our AFFO per share guidance range to $1.08 to $1.12. We have
provided detail around the building blocks, but let me comment on this implied fourth quarter range as it relates to fourth quarter 2021
AFFO per share of $0.31, which is a challenging comp due to the low NOI line items, even though we are increasing full year 2022
guidance.
Comparing the implied fourth quarter AFFO per share range to fourth quarter 2021, please note the following. Operating performance is
expected to be up meaningfully at the total company NOI level for the fourth quarter 2022 versus last year's fourth quarter. However,
core SG&A interest, cash taxes and maintenance capital expenditures are all expected to be higher, which are offsetting this operating
performance improvement and weighing on AFFO per share. Additionally, FX headwinds are weighing on AFFO per share in this
comparison.
Please keep in mind that our guidance does not include the impact of acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity beyond which
has been previously announced. Lastly, please refer to our IR supplemental for detail on the additional assumptions embedded in this
guidance.
Now let me turn the call back to George for some closing remarks.
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Thanks, Marc. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter and our path forward. We continue to enhance our internal
capabilities around controlling what we can control. We have made good progress on our 4 near-term priorities. Our core same-store
pool is recovering nicely as we see economic occupancy meaningfully improve, and we continue to reprice our business to offset known
inflation. Within the same-store pool, we can expect to see service NOI margins continue to improve as we move towards our optimal
perm-to-temp ratio and stabilize our turnover rate.
I would like to thank the Americold team for their hard work and contributions to our performance. These positive improvements are a
result of the combined efforts of all of our associates around the world, and I'm extremely proud of all they've accomplished so far this
year.
Thank you again for joining us today, and we will now open the call for your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
George, can you maybe comment on how we should think about throughput volumes, I mean, considering that next year, probably we'll
have sort of an economic slowdown? I know you're down sort of 1.3% in the quarter, you said. But how do you -- how should we think
about that -- so that volume level, if sort of '23 and '24 remain challenged from an economic perspective?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Well, I think it will remain challenged. If I listen to our retail customers, they're citing smaller basket sizes and less foot traffic through the
stores. So I think it will remain down. As you know, there is some fixed cost in there. So that's why when it is down, we can successfully
take out the variable costs. But we can't really deal with the fixed cost, which impacts us to a degree. But I don't expect it to improve, and
I don't expect it to materially decline.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And I guess my second question is on labor turnover remaining elevated. Maybe talk generally about sort of the initiatives you're
sort of implementing at Americold and to sort of retain the workers.
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Yes, we're making progress. I mean we added about 150 permanent positions in Q3. So if you recall, we quoted that we were down about
2,000 open positions at the start of the year. We've reduced that to about 1,500 by the middle of the year, and now we're down around
1,400. We've got a ton of different activities in terms of increased recruitment and buddy systems, compensation based on performance.
We've got it surrounded as best we can. It's just a very challenging market and very difficult to retain people. Easier to attract people than
it was in the past, much more difficult to retain them.

Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
George, I kind of want to talk about how operating results today compare to pre-COVID levels? It looks like economic occupancy in the
third quarter is over 80%. I mean that's well above where it was pre-COVID. So I mean is it fair to say that occupancy is all the way back
to where it was pre-COVID?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
I don't think it's well above. I think it's, if I remember correctly, just a little short. I think we're at 81% versus 80%. But to your point, it's
come back very well in the U.S. It never really changed in Europe to be honest. I mean we've held our occupancy there very well. And
we've had a little bit of change in Australia and New Zealand. But I would say it's 95% of the way back, and the challenge for us now is to
operate efficiently with brand-new associates.
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
And one thing, Mike -- this is Rob -- that I would add is our fixed commitments have increased pretty significantly since even pre-COVID,
and that's definitely helping us even in an environment where there's still a gap between economic and physical occupancy.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then what is the difference? And I guess I know margins are lower today just given the issues that you're having with labor and
all those inflationary costs. I mean I guess how much more -- I guess you said this in your prepared remarks. But how much more can
rates are going to go on the run rate basis between what you reported in the third quarter and what you're going to realize in the fourth
quarter? And then how far are you away from like pre-COVID margins based off of that?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
I'll take the first one. I would expect that there's typically 100 or 200 basis points of pricing that does not impact the quarter we're in and
kind of rolls into the next quarter. I think in the last quarter, we said we were at 7% and expected it to be closer to 8% on a run rate basis,
so a basis point to 2 in there when we price during a quarter. So that's the first half.
We're still, I would say, significantly off historic margins in the handling business, and that gets back to the retention, the turnover, the
fact that we have so many associates new to their job. At one point, we calculated close to 40% of our associates were in the job less than
12 months. That's not unusual in the industry right now. And until they become well trained and skilled at what they're doing, we're going
to have efficiency issues. So until we get that under control, retention gets back to pre-COVID levels, then I think we get back to margins
that are pre-COVID levels.
 
Operator
Next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
George, I wanted to follow up maybe on what you were just touching on. I think you said in your prepared comments, no more pressure
on labor costs. And I don't know if that was just net of your pass-throughs or you think you've actually solved kind of the gross
organization of that problem. And then you had said, I think previously, you had anticipated kind of stabilization of the business from a
top line second half of '23 and 6 months later, getting to that margin recovery. Do you move that up today? Do you feel like you're just
much closer to full stabilization today?

Well, I feel like occupancy is recovering nicely obviously. Dave, I still think we've got a real challenge on labor. I mean retention, the loss
at 77% of people, so 7 out of 10 people don't stay with us long enough to become productive. We'll never be efficient with those numbers.
Those retention numbers have to get better, and they have to get to pre-COVID levels before we can get our services margins to
pre-COVID levels.
So I'd say that that's the challenge. And at the rate we're going, we certainly will not achieve the retention rates we need this year and
probably will struggle next year to get it all the way back to pre-COVID levels.

So top line coming back faster, maybe margin coming back a little slower, net-net, maybe equal to where you were last quarter, a little
better?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
I think that's a fair way to say it, top line coming back faster driven by price, right, mostly and occupancy and margins coming back slower
due to the drag in the services business with labor.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up maybe on Europe, I wanted to ask about your ability to kind of pass through the utility cost
there, clearly, has been a concern and an overhang. Are there any differences between what you're experiencing in Europe maybe from a
cost pass-through perspective versus the U.S.?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Not from a cost pass-through perspective. We can price surcharge in Europe just as we did in the U.S., and we can pass through the labor
cost just as we did in the U.S. It's just that the power increases came very fast in big percentages, right? We've got markets that have 2x
power pricing and 3x power pricing. It's -- they're big numbers, and we're passing them along. But the lag is 30 days on that, and you
know in our normal pricing, it's 60 to 90. So it's just getting the pricing caught up with the inflation and the difference being it's really
come on fast in Europe.

Next question, Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Are there any noticeable differences that you've seen in terms of activity levels coming from, say, retail versus foodservices?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
We don't really measure the business that way. We measure it more on a site basis. Maybe, Rob, you can comment. I don't know of any
velocity differences I would point out between manufacturing and retail. I don't know if you...
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
Not a lot between those. I mean, certainly, we're pleased with some of the recovery that's happened in our food manufacturing business,
but I wouldn't say anything to speak of there between foodservice and retail.

Next question, Vince Tibone with Green Street.
 
Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Retail and Industrial
How do you think the Kroger-Albertsons merger will impact your business, assuming the deal is completed?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
I don't know that it will. We don't have any business with Kroger at the moment and -- or shortly, we will not. And Albertsons is not a
huge customer of ours. So you might want to comment, Rob.
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
Yes, we have -- there is a facility that we have that has a long-term agreement in place, fixed commitment with Albertsons, Safeway, and
I think we feel very confident that, that business will continue. Outside of that, it -- we don't see any real significant impact of that merger
on our business.
 
Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Retail and Industrial
Great. That's helpful. Can you just quantify the Albertsons in terms of the percentage of rents or NOI just to help frame it?
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
Yes, almost immaterial.
 
Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Retail and Industrial
Okay. And then maybe just one more for me. I mean you mentioned the challenges you're experiencing on the development front. Can
you discuss the current supply landscape for the cold storage industry more broadly in the U.S. and any notable changes in recent
months?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
I didn't really -- I didn't get the question.
 
Scott Henderson
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Senior VP of Capital Markets, Treasury & IR
Vince, can you repeat the question?
 
Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Retail and Industrial
Sorry about that. Just -- my kind of question was just on the supply landscape broadly in the U.S. Any notable changes you're seeing in
recent months?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
No, I can't point to anything noticeable in our landscape and certainly impacting our business. Do you know, Rob?
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
There has been some announcements, but I'd tell you, we haven't seen a lot of those come to fruition, to be honest with you, and there's
been no noticeable impact on any of our business as a result of potential new capacity. We quoted our churn rate in our prepared
remarks, and it's remained very consistent, so no material impact.
 
Marc Jason Smernoff
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Executive VP
And obviously, our occupancy is rising. So we feel like we're positioned pretty well, and the landscape really hasn't changed.

Next question, Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
So just taking a step back and looking at the labor situation that we've gone through for the past couple of years and even before this
period, labor has always been a big part of the business and even like workers' comp issues have come up time to time. Isn't the past 2
years the kind of biggest case to make for more automation in this business? And how do you think about that? And have you started --
have you -- what kind of ideas have you come across? Maybe thinking outside the box, I'm not sure if partnering with some technology
companies might make sense. Just curious on your overall thoughts there.
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Well, automation, as you know, when we came out of COVID, automation was what everybody wanted or our largest customer, I should
say, wanted. We constructed several automated facilities, 1 right here in Atlanta and 2 coming on next year for a large retailer and then
building supplies and inflation hit. And that's really put a damper on large-scale automated facilities. We priced one recently identical to
one of the buildings I just mentioned, and costs were up almost 40%. So that makes the business case tough to pencil out, and it also
makes customers nervous about that type of investment in terms of how they get a return on it. So it slowed down the automation build
pretty significantly.
We do have programs to semi-automate conventional facilities. We run those through our supply chain solutions group. We use
consultation with customers to demonstrate how we can semi-automate facilities. But there's no substitute for a building that's built
specifically to be highly automated. So there are some things we can do on a hybrid basis, but beyond that, it's either conventional or a
large-scale automation building that's right now difficult to pencil out.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. And turning to your development pipeline, you obviously have several projects that are slated to contribute cash flow in the coming
year. Can you provide some guidance on that part of the puzzle for 2023? Like how much NOI contribution should we expect for your
development projects that are currently not in the run rate today?
 
Marc Jason Smernoff
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Executive VP
Yes. We'll be providing full year guidance as we normally do in February for next year. I think what you can see, as detailed in the
supplement, there is a number of development starts planned for next year. Many of those, especially the large, more complicated types
that will be coming on at the high automated sites, they'll typically have a ramp period that will span out beyond that first year period. I
think the one difference, as we've noted on prior calls as well, even is that many of these sites are dedicated buildings to specific
customers. So as they start to onboard, we get the full benefit of the rent and storage as soon as they start inbounding product.
So we'll be providing further guidance for the full year on that pool as it relates to our guidance for next year. But I would look to the stuff
we haven't moved off of any of the timing to full stabilization as detailed in the supp.
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
And we're really excited about the 3 deliveries that we had in the back half of this year, our Dunkirk facility and the 2 that we announced
today with Dublin and Barcelona. Both those facilities are inbounding product as we speak. And so they'll have a nice kind of
wrap-around impact as we go into next year.

Next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Wanted to dig into some of the market share comments you made in the prepared remarks. Who do you gain share from? Is it from your
large competitors or from smaller players? And where can market share go, you think, as you continue to improve service levels?
 
Marc Jason Smernoff
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Executive VP
Yes. I mean I think we're seeing that we're winning more than our fair share of new business development opportunities. I do think some
of those come from smaller competitors as we have the opportunity to deploy more capital than others. Also, we're seeing customers
that may have done some of this business themselves, more interested in outsourcing the business to somebody like us. As the
environment has gotten more challenging, we're taking advantage of that opportunity as well.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Got it. So pre-COVID occupancy was 81%, and you're gaining share. Like where could occupancy kind of top out? Could you go much
higher than 81% as you kind of gain market share?
 
Marc Jason Smernoff
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Executive VP
Look, I think we're focused on getting recovery back to pre-COVID levels, and we are making very good progress, as you saw this quarter,
where we saw in our same-store overall occupancy improve 437 basis points on an economic basis. But we are still well below pre-COVID
levels, especially when you look on the full year basis.
So as we've said in prior commentary, our manufacturing clients, in particular, people and even our retailers are very focused on adding
some resiliency to their supply chain and efficiency. And we think, over time, that should benefit outlooks around occupancy.
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Yes. I just want to add also, we're growing with existing companies as well. As they solve their staffing issues and they ramp up their
manufacturing capability, we're growing with them as their output increases. So while that's not technically market share, that's not
business that we didn't have to win back. Everybody has to win back business in this environment. And we've been successful in
recapturing what we owned in the past as well as taking what Rob mentioned.

Next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.
 
William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
We're a long way away from this. But what happens when we get to disinflation? What happens when energy prices go back down,
assuming they do at some point? How quickly does -- do your tenants come back to you and look for rate adjustments?
 
Marc Jason Smernoff
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Executive VP
Yes. In particular around power, that's why we use a surcharge mechanism because it's designed to move up and down. So as rates rise,
the surcharge comes on. When rates fall, you can take the surcharge off. It follows the same lag effect on the way up as it does on the
way down.
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
So that's a pure pass-through. There's no accretive margin there. It's strictly cost recovery. On the labor inflation side, I don't think
anybody expects labor rates to go back to where they were. So those increases would be permanent on the basis that, again, the labor
rates are here to stay. We don't view those as transitory at all.
 
William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Do you get more pushback on these increases from certain geographic areas? Or is it -- I mean I know they have to take it to do business.
But is there a different attitude, different geographic locations?
 
Robert Scott Chambers
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer
Yes. No, because we are really data-driven and targeted in the approach, so this is not like a peanut butter approach where it's the same
rate increase across every site or every geography. We're using indices. We're using real data. We're using actual invoice level detail from
our facilities to share with customers. And that allows the conversations to be extraordinarily rational. And I think it's appreciated that we
take that approach versus the peanut butter spread.

Next question, Craig Mailman with Citi.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
George, I just want to go back to your commentary on the improvement here in less temp labor. I'm just kind of curious. At the time of the
call last quarter, clearly, this was still a pressure. I mean is that an end-of-quarter metric, that 10% improvement? Was that average? And
how are you guys managing that given the churn that you're having with, I guess, the employee base, even though you're bringing in
people faster?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
That's an end-of-quarter metric, Craig. We snapped the line at the end of the quarter, and we essentially do a tally. So we know where we
are on a like-for-like basis. And we're managing it through a number of programs we've got in place, whether it's buddy systems so that
an individual can learn from a peer versus a supervisor or a boss, introducing people to one another, trying to create an environment
where people essentially make friends at work. We -- the data shows that when you like coming to work and you like the people that you
work with, you show up more often and you stay with your job. I mean there are all kinds of techniques.
We've got a ton of effort focused on it in our human resource group and in our ops group. It's just a very challenging environment. I think
people like the pay rates, and they like the benefits, and that's why we're seeing a lot of people show up at the door. But they
underestimate what it takes to work in a cold environment. And I think that's contributing to the churn.
I'm less concerned about the churn as long as we keep adding permanent people as we have been because I view it as a process you have
to go through. And that's why I believe that the rates we're paying are appropriate. Now if people stop showing up, we'd have to take a
different action. But right now, we're getting plenty of applicants, and the churn is just trying to find the few applicants that can work in
our environment and then enjoy the pay and benefits we have.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Right. I guess my point is that was a pretty positive statement in the beginning of the call, but at a point in time, I'm just kind of trying to
get a sense of how that trends. Is it sustainable? Do you -- does the third quarter just -- were there a couple of things that just came
together that drove the beat and then the decision to raise here after the whole discussion last quarter about not raising, right?
There's been just a little bit of a whipsaw in the messaging here almost since June NAREIT when it seemed that things are getting better.
Then we pulled back, and now it seems like things are getting better again. It's just it's hard to calibrate, I guess, as we're heading into
'23 to say, is this the bottom from an AFFO standpoint, and we're going to bounce off of here? Or is this going to be kind of a slower ramp
off the bottom? Or have we hit bottom, if that makes sense?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
No, I understand the question. Look, if you go back to June, we cited the headwinds that we had, and -- which were largely unknown in
terms of scope and magnitude. We didn't have our refinance done. There were a lot of issues there. The core business performed very
well in the second quarter.
Third quarter got real -- a lot better due to occupancy. That was the main driver. We did make progress on labor. We did make progress
on pricing and handling. We didn't make tremendous project -- progress on productivity at handling and that gets back to the labor issue
we just discussed. But I would say the main driver between Q2 and Q3 is occupancy, and we don't expect that to go backwards. So
hopefully, that helps.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
And then just one quick final one. The -- we kind of -- someone hit on it earlier, just the price increases and the tenant response to that. I
mean if we are going into sort of a weaker environment, what's the pushback outside of the [NRE] surcharge has been from tenants
regarding just the continued kind of adjustment in rate here if they're worried about kind of weakness? People have smaller baskets at
the grocery stores, there's significant food inflation, right? Are they guarding for a pullback here in terms of headcount? Kind of how does
that fit in with you guys continuing to try to kind of keep pushing through the cost and improve your margins potentially at the expense of
[rates]?
 
George F. Chappelle
Americold Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO & Trustee
Well, I don't think that -- if you go back to our script, we said we do not expect labor inflation going forward. We seem to have found the
equilibrium on what we need to pay people to show up and at least join us and see if they can work in our environment. So again, with all
the applicants showing up, that tells me that our rates are probably stable, and we don't see inflation going further. Our customers
understand that we have to pay people to work on their behalf, and they are pretty realistic in terms of what it takes to hire somebody
today, both in terms of pay rates and benefits.
And as Rob mentioned, when we lay out that data specific to a location and a customer location, they're not contentious discussions that
might be around timing when we take the price or do we it take in 1 chunk or 2 chunks or those types of discussions we always have. But
there's nobody who has come to us and said we just don't believe the numbers what we think you're trying to margin up because this has
been all about trying to get back to pre-COVID margins. That's all we've been trying to do through pricing. And customers understand
that because they're trying to do the same thing quite frankly.
