Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, operator, and good morning, and thank you to those of us joining us on the Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc.’s
third quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined this morning by Anastasia Mironova, our Chief Financial Officer. From a macro perspective,
the dominant themes remain the same, continued efforts by central banks to fight persistent inflation, resulting in additional interest
rate increases, continued capital markets volatility and an overall slowdown in capital transaction activity, all of which are permeating
the real estate market.
Despite the somewhat challenging backdrop, for the third quarter, ARI reported distributable earnings comfortably in excess of the
common stock dividend and significant progress on several key asset management and balance sheet optimization initiatives. It is worth
noting that even with a positive move in the stock this morning, ARI's current quarterly dividend run rate of $0.35 per share, ARI is paying
common stockholders a 13-plus percent annualized yield while trading at approximately 70% of book value with earnings supported by
our portfolio consisting of 98% floating rate loans.
Importantly, we expect ARI's robust pace of originations over the past 18 months will enable the company to continue generating
distributable earnings that support the common stock dividend while maintaining a more selective approach to any incremental capital
deployment consistent with a focus on maintaining liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. In taking this approach, ARI is fortunate to
benefit from Apollo's broader commercial real estate debt platform, which originates over $10 billion of loan transactions per year.
Apollo remains active in the marketplace, originating and closing transactions on behalf of other managed capital, which enables ARI to
access real-time market data and information as we assess the use of the company's investable capital.
Shifting to capital management. I would like to highlight a few key milestones with respect to the right side of ARI's balance sheet.
During the quarter, ARI repaid $345 million of convertible notes that matured in August with existing liquidity and without the need to
access the choppy capital markets. Also, during the past year, ARI has entered new asset-specific lending facilities with Banco Santander
and MUFG, respectively, expanding ARI's roster of scalable capital relationships. In addition, the company sold down approximately
$328 million of a future funding obligation for one of ARI's largest U.K. loans, which is financing the construction of a mixed-use property
in a prime Central London location. ARI ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of unencumbered assets and a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.8
times.
Turning to the portfolio. There are several important updates with respect to the focused loans. We executed a contract to sell the
properties underlying ARI's Miami Design District loan. The purchasing group has posted a substantial deposit, and we expect the
transaction to close prior to year-end. As such, ARI reversed $53 million of the previously recorded $68 million loan impairment and we'll
retain some additional performance-based economics that may result in additional recapture of the remaining impairment. In
connection with this transaction, ARI will provide seller financing consistent with current market terms enabling ARI to redeploy a
portion of the return capital into a new performing loan.
In addition, in connection with the closing of the construction financing provided by Bank of America and M&T Bank for ARI's
multi-family development in Brooklyn, known as the Brook. The investment was transferred to ARI's balance sheet as real estate owned,
and ARI recognized a $44 million gain to book value, which reflects the difference between the prior loan balance and the current fair
value of the development. We're extremely pleased with the progress made on these focused loans, which highlights the strength of our
asset management capabilities in addition to our ongoing commitment to and focus on the preservation of capital.
Turning to the loan on 111 West 57th Street commonly known as the Steinway Building. The property was recently recapitalized and the
existing senior mortgage loan and a portion of the senior mezzanine loan were refinanced with a new senior loan provided by both ARI
and a global money center bank. The bank is also providing 75% financing to ARI for its portion of the senior loan.
In connection with the recapitalization, ARI funded a portion of the senior loan at approximately a 50% LTV with no change to ARI's
existing junior mezzanine loan positions. Based upon the units closed subsequent to quarter end as well as units under contract that are
expected to close by year-end, we anticipate ARI's exposure will be reduced by approximately $150 million by the end of this year. Before
turning the call over to Anastasia, I wanted to spend a few minutes on ARI's European portfolio. We added an additional page of
disclosure to our supplemental information package this quarter to provide incremental color on the exposure as loans secured by
properties in Europe now represent slightly more than 40% of ARI's portfolio.
As a reminder, Apollo has been active in the European commercial real estate lending market since 2014 when we moved one of the
senior members of our team to London to oversee the expansion of Apollo Commercial Real Estate debt platform. Today, the team in
Europe is comprised of 12 people all of whom have done an outstanding job contributing to our success in capturing market share and
developing Apollo's reputation as one of the leading non-bank lenders to the commercial real estate sector throughout Western Europe.
Importantly, as we have expanded our origination activity there, the transaction types, the quality of equity sponsorship and the deal
structures have been consistent with ARI's U.S. loan originations.
ARI only transact in countries with legal systems and structures that provide necessary lender protections. Further, ARI does not take
currency risk on lending in Europe. Any asset-specific financing used by ARI is transacted in local currency, and we work with internal and
external advisers to appropriately hedge expected principal and interest payments. We consistently review the effectiveness of the
hedging strategies used, which to-date have proven to be highly effective. With respect to ARI's European portfolio, operating
performance at the asset level is very market and property-specific, and has generally been positive to date consistent with the
post-pandemic economic recovery. At quarter end, ARI had 25 positions in Europe totaling $3.8 billion, approximately 2/3 of which are
secured by properties in the United Kingdom. 99% of the portfolio consists of senior loans and the portfolio has a weighted average LTV
of 62%.
The equity sponsors are some of the most sophisticated real estate private equity owners and operators in the world, with Blackstone
being our largest borrower in Europe. In addition, 5 loans totaling $900 million have debt subordinated to ARI's senior mortgage
position. At present, ARI's European portfolio -- entire European portfolio is risk rated 3, and there are no asset-specific reserves. In terms
of property-type exposures, the non-UK portion of the portfolio is over 50% comprised of industrial and hotel assets. Given the ongoing
strength of the U.S. dollar, European hospitality assets continue to perform very well, and the assets underlying these loans continue to
report positive RevPAR metrics.
With respect to the U.K. assets, the portfolio is broadly diversified across multiple property types split between London and other major
cities. Approximately, 1/3 of ARI's U.K. exposure is in retail assets, which include outlet centers and retail warehouse properties, both of
which have typically outperformed traditional retail due to lower occupancy cost and a focus on discounted goods. At present, we're
comfortable with ARI's European portfolio, but we recognize that the market has challenges, including heightened recessionary risks
from persistent inflation, rising interest rates and the added burden of increased uncertainty around energy supply given the reliance on
Russia.
As a result, we'll continue to monitor ARI's European portfolio closely and where possible, be proactive in managing and limiting any
asset-specific exposures. With respect to new capital deployment in Europe, the bar has risen significantly, given the economic
uncertainty, coupled with the decline in relative value as compared to the U.S., primarily due to the impact of rising rates and its impact
on currency hedging costs.
With that, I will turn the call over to Anastasia to review ARI's financial results for the quarter.
 
Anastasia Mironova
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Secretary & Treasurer
Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. ARI reported another stable quarter of financial results in Q3, with distributable
earnings prior to the realized gain on investments of $52 million or $0.37 per share. GAAP net income available to common stockholders
was $180 million or $1.27 per share and diluted net income of $1.13 per share. The progress with our focused loans positively impacted
our book value per share this quarter, which prior to the general CECL allowance and depreciation increased 6% to $16.12 and as
compared to $15.19 at the end of the second quarter. This includes $0.38 in net reversals of specific CECL allowance, $0.31 in realized
gain from the title acquisition of the Brook, and $0.23 in net unrealized gain on our currency and interest hedges, which continue to be
beneficial in this volatile ForEx climate.
As Stuart mentioned, we take several steps to mitigate our foreign currency risk, given that 42% of the loans in our portfolio are secured
by properties in Europe. We hedge our exposure on a net equity basis for all foreign currency nominated transactions by entering into
forward currency contracts at closing. Forward point impact on foreign currency contracts resulted in $1.5 million of realized gains during
the quarter, which also positively impacts our distributable earnings.
Our portfolio remains well-positioned for rising interest rates as 98% of our loans are floating rate. And as of quarter end, all of our U.S.
and U.K. floating rate loans were in excess of their respective floors. An additional increase of 50 basis points in the U.S. and the U.K. and
Europe would lead to an incremental $0.04 and $0.03 per share, respectively, of net interest income. With respect to our borrowings, we
are in compliance with all covenants and continue to maintain strong liquidity. We ended the quarter with $361 million of total liquidity,
which was a combination of cash and undrawn credit capacity on our existing facilities and $1.1 billion of unencumbered loan assets. Our
debt-to-equity ratio at quarter end decreased to 2.8 times.
Turning to our CECL allowance for the quarter, as Stuart mentioned, we had several positive developments in connection with our focus
loans. During the quarter, 53 million specific CECL allowance was reversed on our Miami Design District loan as the collateral which
secures the loan is under contract to be sold in the near-term at a higher value than the carrying value of the loan pre-reversal. In
addition, ARI's general CECL allowance decreased by $2.6 million, primarily due to portfolio seasoning and previously mentioned sale of
the unfunded commitments in our loan secured with a mixed-use asset and land. This was partially offset by one new loan originations
and a more adverse macroeconomic outlook.
And with that, we'd like to open the line for questions. Operator, please go ahead.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Doug Harter with Credit Suisse.
 
Douglas Michael Harter
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director
Hoping you could talk about your -- how you're envisioning the coming months, quarters playing out in terms of the level of liquidity you
expect to hold and capital deployment into new loans? And I guess, also along that, would you consider various parts of the capital
structure given the valuation you mentioned at the beginning of the call?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Thanks, Doug. Look, I think as I indicated in my remarks, I think from the lens of continuing to generate earnings that comfortably
support the dividend. I think the portfolio is at that level right now, given what we know on our side vis-à-vis future funding requirements,
as well as some expected repayments. We're certainly still in the market looking at transactions, but I would say at a high level, biased
more towards liquidity and keeping powder dry versus feeling the need to be fully invested at any one point in time.
We still look at things, we still underwrite things. We will still come across things that fit from a portfolio perspective, but I would be
biased towards keeping excess dry powder and deal flow to be muted between now and the end of the year. To the latter part of your
question, we certainly look at the -- all parts of the capital structure on a daily basis, frequent dialogue, both internally and with external
advisers about opportunities to do something in the capital structure. We've got a share repurchase plan in place with plenty of capacity.
But again, I think in a period of uncertainty for lack of a better phrase. I think biased at this point towards marshalling capital, keeping
dry powder and less things get to a level where they're just too compelling not to do anything given potential ROE from deploying the
capital.
 
Douglas Michael Harter
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director
And then page in your slide deck that showed you don't have a lot of maturities -- final maturities in the next year or 2. But can you just
talk about how you expect your borrowers to be able to -- the impact of refinancing, given the much higher rates that they would be
facing today?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Look, I think, obviously, various situations dependent in those situations to date despite higher costs where people have achieved or
made progress on business plan. We're certainly getting paid off. There's still capital available to people to pay us off. But conversely,
we've had other situations, which has existed by the way, for our entire 14-year history where people either due to wanting to make more
progress in a business plan or a choppy financing market, there might be situations where things get extended in exchange for additional
subordinate capital, either in the form of mezz pref equity or common equity coming into the deal, and in those situations where people
are willing to add more economic support to a transaction.
We're certainly willing to consider extending our loan to the extent we feel like we continue to be well protected. I think a lot of --
ultimately, a lot of what plays out will depend on how right or wrong the forecasts are. Obviously, the forecast right now by many assume
rates coming down significantly in the latter part of next year. I think it remains to be seen whether that comes to fruition or not.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Stephen Laws with Raymond James.
 
Stephen Albert Laws
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Stuart, first, I want to start kind of you mentioned a higher hurdle to clear, I think, with how you phrased it as far as deploying capital. I
think that was in your Europe comments, I'm guessing lies across the board, just kind of given the comments around liquidity. But maybe
how do you think about Europe versus the U.S. as far as new investments with where they are in the respective cycles or maybe even
needs to be bifurcated even further to the U.K. versus Continental Europe? And how do you think about the relative attractiveness of each
market right now?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. It's a great question. And yes, you could certainly assume my high-level comment around Europe being a higher bar applies to the
U.S. as well as I think my response to Doug sort of reaffirmed. Look, I think as we look at the world, right, there was a period of time call
it, early coming out of the pandemic through much of '21, where as you think about lending and underwriting deals for sponsorship, real
estate risk, confidence in business plan, et cetera. There was an economic pickup or return pickup to doing things in Europe, both in
terms of call it, like-for-like achievable return on the loans we were making post-financing, as well as a positive pickup when hedging
back to the U.S., just given interest rate differentials, that has obviously disappeared given interest rate moves and the strength of the
dollar.
As we think about Europe versus the U.S., and obviously, we spent a lot of time talking about it from a macro perspective. I think high
level, while Europe is suffering from high inflation as well. Interestingly enough, if you look at the underlying components of that
inflation, most of what's driving inflation in Europe is energy and food. So it's fairly targeted, fairly specific. And one could argue that as
new supplies are generated, as alternative sources are created, there's a chance to bring that inflation down perhaps more quickly than
in the U.S., where the areas of inflation in the U.S. are more diversified and in many respects, are more driven by the service sectors than
the good sectors, which are a little bit harder to get a handle on. That being said, I think looking over the next couple of quarters, I'd say,
in our mind, there's a little bit more concern over the European economies and there are in the U.S. economies. And as a result, I would
say, all things being equal, bias towards doing things in the U.S. versus doing things in Europe.
I think if you want to get more granular vis-à-vis the U.K. and other parts of Western Europe, while certainly the political machinations in
the U.K. have been somewhat interesting over the last 3 months to say the least. I think it does speak to a system that is very transparent
addressing what they need to address, unclear when they get to the finish line. But as one who's been over in Europe twice in the last 6
weeks. There is still a lot of dry powder looking at the U.K. There's still a lot of dry powder looking at other parts of Europe. The strength
of the dollar in many respects has attracted more capital to look at those markets.
So the markets seem to be functioning. We're a little bit more cautious just given where the economies are right now, given the fact that
Europe represents 40% of our portfolio. And that's sort of a long-winded way of saying there's a high bar for all deals that we look at
right now. But on par, we're more biased towards trying to find things in the U.S. versus Europe.
 
Stephen Albert Laws
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
I appreciate the color on that, Stuart, and the additional is in the deck. Anastasia, I have one follow-up on the Miami asset. So I think $15
million of the specific reserve is remaining, and I think you commented that, that asset is under contract and expected to close maybe 4Q
or maybe it was just soon. But when we do see that close, we see the remaining specific reserve run through distributable earnings as a
realized loss, or is the accounting going to be different given the situation?
 
Anastasia Mironova
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Secretary & Treasurer
Yes, I think the remainder of the reserve that you currently see in the books is probably a good indication for the realized loss that we
expect to realize once the asset sale closes.
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
But just that's the technical answer, but just to be back to my comments, Stephen, we will potentially maintain some additional
economics in the deal that while we'll be realizing the loss. I would say there's an optimistic view that we may claw back more of those
economics over time.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
On the Miami Design District loan, what's the size of the new loan?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We're not -- we'll announce it when the deal is done. But if you think about value, will be a fairly conservative LTV and the loan will be
plus or minus $100 million to $125 million based on rough purchase price.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. Thanks very much. On 111 West 57th Street, can you give some details around number of unsold units, what the revised maturity
date is and if there's been any recent contracts over the last, say, 6 months?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. High level, the building still has more than 50% to be sold. It's a 60-unit building. So you could do the math. There have been -- if
you look at the last 6 months, there's been plus or minus a handful of units put under contract. The maturity date of the new loan off the
top of my head, I think, is late '24, but I'll get it for you before the call is over. And I would say, high level foot traffic remains healthy,
volatility in the capital markets overall is not a positive thing. Those units under contract continuing to close, I think are a positive as they
create more life around the asset. So we're continuing to grind through it. And the maturity date on the new loan is September of next
year, so September of '23.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
That's the initial maturity and there's extension options.
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. Because it seems unlikely that there'll be 30 units or maybe there's more unsold units than that to be sold by September of next
year?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Actually, I might have just misspoke the actual maturity date is that's what I thought. It's 9/24 result.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
September 2024. Okay, great.
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes (inaudible).
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
I believe, do you view the moves that were made as a de-risking of the position because now you're in the first mortgage and you also
received 50% financing from the 2 money center banks, thereby sort of validating the investment case?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
A couple of things, partial -- I think a de-risking -- I think it puts us more partial de-risking. I think the de-risking is really, as you think
about the way dollars flow on units being sold and sort of what gets paid back over time. Obviously, the senior position is still in the
priority position, but it will allow us to start paying off hopefully some of the bottom parts of the structure a little sooner. And you at 50%
LTV given that the original senior lender was looking for an exit and had certain rights. We were able to craft something at the senior
level that worked a little bit better for the project on a go-forward basis.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
The London office loan, what's the update there since it missed maturity in October?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. There is a mezzanine lender subordinate to our position, which was intentional given that we originally created the whole loan and
then sold a subordinate position to the mezzanine lender. High level, we believe there is a path towards getting us refinanced out. And if
for whatever reason that didn't come to fruition, we force the sale of the asset. And we believe we are well protected in an asset sale. But
at this point, the expectation is that with the -- providing a little bit more time will end up getting refinanced out.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Just thinking about near-term loan maturities in 2023, there's a few that jump out. One of your peers had some risk rating downgrades
on the office side. So for example, there's a Chicago office loan with January maturity, how are you generally thinking about the loans
that are coming up for maturity in 2023?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes, you should assume there's been dialogue with the borrowers already. In some situations, business plan has been achieved, and
there's a clear path to repayment. In other situations, as I alluded, I think, to Doug Harter, active dialogue around trading time for
additional capital coming in subordinate to us. But in everything that presents as a near-term maturity comfortable with our path to
either get repaid or to get our leverage decreased through additional capital such that from an accounting perspective, obviously, no
additional reserves or asset-specific reserves were taking.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
And lastly, the commentary around the dividend, was that to signal maintenance of the current dividend policy that with the rising rate
environment, current liquidity, the positive moves in asset management that earnings would exceed the dividend?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
It was meant to indicate that we see a path towards comfortably covering the dividend going forward.

Our next question comes from Steve Delaney with JMP Securities.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
So Stuart, if I had seen your report come out last night and you had resolved one of Brooklyn or Miami, that would have been a fantastic
-- I don't know how you pulled off 2 in one quarter, but you ought to buy a lottery ticket while you're on a roll here. So congratulations.
On the Brooklyn property now, so I mean, you are now in an equity position, right? And will all the financing be third-party, or are you
going to need to be -- provide some financing on it as well?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
All the financing will be third-party. We will put -- per the financing, we will put additional equity into the project, like you in on where
there's a balance between financing and equity. That being said, there are some very, very early-stage discussions around potentially
bringing in someone to partner with us on the equity side. I don't want to bank on that yet, but while we like the risk of the investment,
we think multifamily in Brooklyn works all day long. We recognize that ARI is not an equity vehicle at the end of the day. So we're just
trying to think through the right mix of equity exposure and investment upside. But as of this point, we feel pretty comfortable with the
way the deal is structured and what we're creating in Brooklyn.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
Great. And in Miami, you're not -- you do not have a future lending obligation as part of that transaction?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We're providing, call it, market seller financing, right? So someone's buying the deal from us, we are providing market-based seller
financing, which I indicated to Jade would be $100 million to $125 million based on where things shake out. And then beyond that, it will
be a structured financing. So like in anything we do, where someone is buying something to create new assets, there'll be an upfront
funding and then there'll be future fundings, but we'll all be within that $100 million to $125 million envelope in total.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
Great. And that's first lien, obviously, on that typical property. West 57th, it sounds like a situation where the project was structurally
messed up. And you simply -- you put more dollars on the table, but you went from a mezz position to a first lien position, or a senior
position. Is that the way to view that?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Look, our last dollar of risk has not changed. But to the best way to structure the top was for us in the bank that we worked with to
take the top and we are very comfortable with the money we've put in at the top. And, obviously, we continue to be comfortable with the
money we've got at the bottom, but nothing changed as you think about the last dollar of risk.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
And we really appreciate the disclosure on Europe, both in terms of the assets and in terms of the hedging, it's really helpful. I did want
to talk about one thing. Stuart, you have indicated taking a conservative approach in terms of deploying capital, maintaining liquidity.
Obviously, there have been allowance reductions due to the successful resolution of a couple of loans. But I am curious how we should be
thinking about the general reserve in the context of your more cautious or more conservative outlook?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Look, I would say, from a macroeconomic perspective, I would say the inputs we put into our CECL reserve, whereas, pessimistic as we've
been from a macroeconomic perspective, the countervailing force to that from a CECL perspective is the influence of portfolio seasoning
on the CECL reserve.
So you've got factors going in both directions, and I will refrain from making any broader editorial comments on CECL in general. But I
know, I'm going to assume that based on your question, it seems odd to see a general CECL reserve going down in a period where
collectively, we're all seeing a little bit more uncertain about where the economy is headed. Our CECL assumptions agree with you that
we're more uncertain about where the economy is headed, but there are also factors in the CECL analysis related to portfolio seasoning
that allow less wave over.
I don't know Anastasia if there's anything you'd add to that.
 
Anastasia Mironova
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Secretary & Treasurer
Yes, that's correct. And the reversal, as Stuart mentioned, is primarily the impact of our seasoning portfolio and the unfunded piece was
also impacted by the sale of our unfunded commitment on a loan secured by a mixed-use property in London. But generally, yes, we did
include the recessionary sentiment and a macroeconomic outlook and that -- go ahead, sorry. So ultimately, I was just echoing Stuart's
comments that our macroeconomic projections included the recessionary sentiment in the market.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And Stuart, yes, good reading between the lines and interesting response in terms of how you're thinking
about it as well, and I can sense a little bit of maybe not frustration, but cognitive dissidence in terms of how you're thinking about it also.
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Fair enough. I think you're right. I think it's -- it is what it is. But I think, look, from our perspective, and I think we've evidenced
always being willing to be on our front set with respect to asset-specific reserves, CECL is somewhat of a mechanical exercise. Most of our
efforts each quarter are around specific assets, specific questions and trying to make sure we are on our front foot with respect to
necessary asset-specific reserves because I think that is the most meaningful disclosure vis-à-vis the portfolio.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
No, I agree. And again, the track record and particularly what we've seen in the last quarter really validates that as well.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Eric Hagen with BTIG.
 
Eric J. Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Some of the disclosure around (inaudible) was really helpful, but what would you say is the upside more broadly for the assets in New
York City? Like fundamentally, are there catalysts specific to New York that investors can maybe think about?
And then the second question is around the structure of the secured funding. Just a general kind of question. Does the lender have the
ability to change the financing terms of the haircut in the middle of the loan term or just maybe the conditions that you think about that
could drive lenders to tighten terms and how much tightening of terms you've seen from this point?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Working backwards, Eric. Yes, on any specific repurchase facility, there's sort of a regular way dialogue between us and the banks
with respect to haircuts, spreads, et cetera. I think obviously, the experience during the pandemic is the best indication of how those
things play out. I think we have always managed those relationships pretty comfortably. I think we've also always maintained a roster of
relationships, which allows us to move assets around as need be.
I would say our experience has more been driven by what a particular banks appetite may be for specific types of assets, given their
overall portfolio as opposed to any specific asset. So to date, not a lot taking place. I think views on certain banks being more
conservative or less conservative are being expressed through indicative terms on new deals. But nothing of a material nature going on
with respect to any change in financing terms broadly. I'm curious, just to clarify your question on the New York assets. Was that broadly
on New York? Was it on specific types of assets? I guess I just help clarify the question.
 
Eric J. Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Sure. It was really more broad. Just to think about the catalyst for that portfolio specifically. And if there's any specific catalysts for New
York that investors can think about relative to the other catalysts that might drive the portfolio?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Look, I think what we're seeing, look, we look at the existing portfolio of ARI deals for New York. We look at many things away from
what would work for ARI in New York. And then we also have real estate opportunity funds that are looking at New York from an equity
perspective, I think -- look, I think the macro drivers of New York continue to be what they've always been, whether it be liquidity,
attractiveness to capital Global Financial Centre, 24-hour city, et cetera, which cuts across a lot of property types. I think more specifically
to the condo market to the extent that 111 West 57th Street was the genesis of the question.
I think the ultimately, that is an asset geared towards ultra high net worth client. There is certainly more than enough wealth globally
with respect to what we're trying to sell. I think the volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets doesn't help. And I would say a
lessening of that volatility or a more confidence that inflation has peaked and is heading down, would be viewed favorably. But
ultimately, our sense is the asset shows well, foot traffic is a good thing as more people like what they're seeing. More international
exposure coming out of the pandemic has been a good thing. I think we're moving towards a point where in most condo projects you
create momentum. And I think the number of units closing both this year as well as what will close between now and the end of the year,
continues to be viewed favorably by the marketplace as it creates more life at the asset.
And the final piece of the puzzle was the completion of the amenity package at the property, which was displayed to plus or minus 150
brokers last week to overwhelmingly favorable reviews. So the asset itself isn't as good a position as it's been in from a physical real
estate perspective. I think velocity of sales would benefit from, at some point, less volatility in the overall capital markets.
 
Eric J. Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. That's helpful. Did you guys say that you sold a loan participation in one of the U.K. loans, can you talk about that and what the
terms of that were?
 
Stuart A. Rothstein
Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We sold the future funding obligations. So we made a loan on a sizable mixed-use project in Central London. 2-plus years ago, give or
take. It was always expected that at some point in the future, we would sell a piece of the future funding obligation. It's a effectively a
construction project which taking place over multiple years. We were plus or minus $300 million funded in our -- into our position. We
did 2 things. We financed in a typical financing our existing outstanding position. And then we sold $328 million of the future funding
obligation to effectively removing a liquidity need for us in the future and also removing further growth of our U.K. portfolio into the
future.
