James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Stacy, and good morning, everyone.
I'm really pleased to report another quarter of phenomenal execution by our Brixmor team that highlights the accelerating and
transformative impacts of our disciplined value-add strategy. Those impacts are reflected in every metric, many of which are post-IPO
records for the company. And importantly, that execution provides exceptional visibility on forward growth through '23 and beyond, even
in a more disruptive economic environment. Allow me to dig into our results and highlight how our all-weather plan positions Brixmor for
continued outperformance.
During the quarter, we signed 1.7 million feet of new and renewal leases at a record rent of $19.26 a foot and a blended cash spread of
14.2%, which included 660,000 square feet of new leases at a record rent of $21.20 and a comparable cash spread of 32%. And as
reflected in our strong net effective rents, we achieved those records while remaining disciplined with capital. This record-setting
performance underscores the transformative impacts of our value-add plan and the related tenant demand to be in our well-located,
highly trafficked centers.
I'm also pleased by the breadth of that demand as we continue to drive strong market share of store openings for our core tenants in
categories like grocery, fast casual, wellness and value apparel. And have also recently brought exciting new concepts to the portfolio
that will drive additional traffic, such as Yardbird, Best Buy's outdoor furniture concept or Bark Social or the Live! by Cordish Venue.
Our leasing activity drove overall leased occupancy to a company record of 93.3%, a year-over-year increase of 180 basis points. And
importantly, we commenced another $14 million of new ABR during the quarter, driving our billed occupancy to 89.6%. Importantly, we
also set another record in small shop occupancy, which rose to 88.8% on new rents achieved of $24.78 a foot. More than any other
milestones unachieved, this growth in occupancy and rate for our small shops truly underscores the transformative follow-on benefits of
our reinvestment strategy.
We also drove our average in-place ABR to over $16 a foot, another record for the company, but which still has plenty of room to run as
demonstrated by the nearly $20 a foot achieved on all new leases over the trailing 12 months. As we've said many times, our attractive
rent basis provides the opportunity to outperform through disruptive environments such as we experienced in 2020 as well as strong
supply-demand environment such as we're experiencing today.
Our execution delivered top line same-store growth of 4.8% and NOI growth of 3.6%, which is particularly impressive when you consider
the drag of 250 basis points from revenues deemed uncollectible due primarily to declining prior period rent collections as we worked
down our remaining receivables. Year-to-date, as we've driven occupancy and improved recovery rates, we've grown bottom line FFO by
6.5% on a comparable basis.
Looking ahead, we have $53 million of signed but not commenced rent, which will commence over the next several quarters as well as
$40 million of annual base rent in our forward new leasing pipeline, even with the declining rate -- or the naturally declining rate of prior
period collections as those receivables are paid in full and the increased possibility of disruption as economic concerns loom, we still
expect continued outperformance in our revenue and NOI growth in '23 and beyond. This level of visible forward growth truly
underscores the all-weather nature of our plan.
Given our increased cash flow and confidence in continued growth, we are pleased to announce a dividend increase of 8.3%, which will
keep us still at one of the lowest payout ratios in the sector as we utilize free cash flow to self-fund our value-add plan without reliance
on the volatile capital markets. Speaking of that plan, our reinvestment pipeline continued to deliver despite ongoing supply chain issues
as we partnered with tenants to get stores open on time.
We stabilized $46 million in projects during the quarter at an incremental yield of 8%, bringing our year-to-date deliveries to $113 million
at a 10% yield, creating significant value even in a higher cap rate environment. Since we began this program, we've completed over
$800 million of reinvestments at an incremental return of 11%. And importantly, we have another $400 million leased and underway,
providing a significant future value creation. Please do check out our At The Center video series on our website that truly highlights the
transformative impacts and accretive returns of our program.
From an investment standpoint, we continued our pause on acquisition, keeping our powder dry as we believe there will be compelling
opportunities in the coming quarters as private less, well-capitalized landlords struggle with upcoming debt maturities and cash flow
constraints. With that said, even in this more challenging capital markets environment, we've continued to find some liquidity to sell
smaller and noncore assets at opportunistic values with over $110 million in sales transactions completed during and subsequent to the
end of the quarter.
And importantly, as Angela will discuss further, we have $1.3 billion of liquidity and no debt maturing until 2024, allowing us to be
opportunistic from an external growth perspective.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela for a detailed discussion of our results, our outlook and our capital structure. Angela?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm pleased to report on another strong quarter of execution by the Brixmor team that highlighted both
the value creation potential of our portfolio and the ability of our platform to harvest the embedded upside. NAREIT FFO was $0.49 per
share in the third quarter, driven by same-property NOI growth of 3.6%. Base rent growth continues to accelerate, contributing 480 basis
points to same-property NOI growth this quarter.
Excluding the impact of lease modifications and rent abatements in the prior period, base rent growth contributed 440 basis points,
representing a 70 basis point acceleration from last quarter, reflecting continued growth in billed occupancy and significant re-leasing
spreads over the last year. Ancillary and other income and percentage rents contributed 80 basis points on a combined basis, while net
expense reimbursements contributed 50 basis points. Revenues deemed uncollectible detracted 250 basis points from same-property
NOI growth, primarily due to the fully expected moderation of out-of-period collections of previously reserved amounts.
Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $21 million or $0.07 per share of out-of-period collections related to prior years. And
our current expectation is that such amounts will be minimal in 2023. As a result, we do expect revenues deemed uncollectible to be a
headwind to both same-property NOI and FFO growth next year as the total level of revenues deemed uncollectible reverts to historical
levels.
Our operational metrics continue to reflect the strength of the current leasing environment despite macro headwinds and the continuing
successful transformation of our portfolio. Billed occupancy was up 60 basis points sequentially, while leased occupancy was up 80 basis
points sequentially. The anchor lease rate now stands at 95.4%, up 60 basis points sequentially, while the small shop lease rate stands
at 88.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially, reflecting another new portfolio record for this metric.
The spread between leased and billed occupancy grew to 370 basis points this quarter; and the total signed but not yet commenced
pool, which includes an additional 50 basis points of GLA related to space that will soon be vacated by existing tenants totaled $53
million. While the size of the pool is in line with last quarter, there's been significant continued velocity within the pool as we commenced
leases representing over $14 million of annualized base rent this quarter while adding $14 million of newly executed leases to the
population.
As we've highlighted in the past, one of the strongest indicators of forward growth is a persistently wide spread between leased and
billed occupancy, while both billed and leased occupancy are increasing. In addition, the blended annualized base rent per square foot
on the signed but not yet commenced pool remains well above $19, approximately 20% above our portfolio average, reflecting the
broad-based impact of our granular reinvestment initiatives.
From a balance sheet perspective, as of September 30, we had $1.3 billion of available liquidity, only 4% floating rate debt and no debt
maturities until mid-2024. As a reminder, with the execution of our amended credit facility in April, we obtained a $200 million delayed
draw term loan that we expect to utilize before April 2023 to continue to extend the duration of the balance sheet. While our existing
$300 million term loan has been swapped through July 2024, the delayed draw term loan has not yet been swapped.
As noted in last night's release, we have also renewed both our $400 million share repurchase program and our $400 million
at-the-market equity offering program, which were set to expire in January, proactively extending our ability to capitalize on a wide range
of capital markets condition.
As Jim highlighted, we are pleased to also announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend last night to $0.26 per share or $1.04 on an
annualized basis. This dividend increase reflects the strong growth in taxable income experienced over the last year while also allowing
the company to retain as much free cash flow as possible to continue the execution of the value-enhancing reinvestment program. The
revised dividend level represents a payout ratio of just over 50% of our third quarter FFO and a dividend yield of 4.8% on last night's
closing stock price.
As it relates to guidance, we have maintained our previous guidance range for same-property NOI growth at 5.5% to 6%, and we have
revised our FFO guidance to a range of $1.94 to $1.97 per share.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Jim, I'm wondering, will there be any pullback on the redevelopment investment given the potential for a recession in '23?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
What we're finding is continued demand as well as highly accretive returns. So even in an environment of increasing costs, we're
offsetting that very effectively with the rent that we're able to achieve. As we've talked a lot about the Live!, our business plan is built for
an environment of higher rates, less liquidity because, it's self-funded. And because importantly, the absolute returns that we're
achieving are quite compelling.
And we also, as you're seeing in all of our metrics, Craig, we're driving some real important follow-on benefit not measured in those
initial returns in terms of follow-on occupancy and rate in our small shops. So we like how our plan is positioned. We like that it allowed
us to outperform during the disruption of COVID, where over that 2.5-year period, we grew our NOI I think at the top of the peer group
but also in a strong environment, such as the 1 we're in today. We're -- really we're seeing more tenant demand than we've seen in quite
some time.
But then importantly, to what's implicit in your question, should we see a reversion to more normalized levels of tenant failure, et cetera,
we believe this reinvestment plan is the way to really position us to outperform in that environment as well.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Great. And then just what are the positive and negatives of having local tenants at 21% of your ABR?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
It's important to have the center be relevant to the community it serves. And one of the things that really struck us through the pandemic
was the strength of that tenancy. We did have some failures. And interestingly, even with the small and local tenants, we saw demand to
backfill those tenants with better, more well-capitalized operators. And so it's a balance.
Obviously, out of the small shop tenancy, whether it's local, regional or national, we're able to drive higher absolute rents. We're typically
able to drive higher embedded growth as well as absolute growth in that portion of our tenancy. But we like importantly how it's
positioned today. We think we've got a very good balance of national, regional and local tenants that provides great visibility on
instability from a cash flow perspective.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Just first question, I guess following up on the local tenants and your -- and that exposure in the portfolio. I'm wondering if you're seeing
any change in the health or ability of your local small shop tenants to pay rent today? Any increase in rent relief requests or otherwise at
all?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Quite the contrary. We're seeing very good strength out of our entire tenant base and particularly in the small shops. It's reflected, Todd,
in the rents and occupancy levels we're achieving, which we're really proud of. And frankly, as we've executed this plan and upgrading
the quality of tenancy, which we think is implicit in our results, but something that's worthy of being highlighted. Our collections levels
continue to be very strong. And importantly, also our traffic levels continue to be very strong to our centers. So we like how we're
positioned.
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes, I just add up as it relates to revenues deemed uncollectible. There's some disclosure on this stuff that gives you a good sense for
what we're reserving as it relates to collection shortfalls for current period revenue and that's been stable over the last few quarters at
around 135 to 140 basis points. So certainly, with some of the macro headlines lately, we have not seen any deterioration in credit quality.
And the other thing I would emphasize, as both Jim and I sort of talked about in our remarks, out-of-period collections of previously
reserved amounts have continued to be pretty significant. We are continuing to collect amounts from 2020 and 2021 and even earlier in
2022. I think that says something despite the fact that there were some delays in payment with those tenants, the fact that many of
those tenants are fully paying off amounts that were underpaid during the pandemic is a really good sign of how they've come through
the last few years and how they're positioned going into a more disruptive economic environment.
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. And I put our collections experience at the top of the group. When you look at what we've been able to drive in terms of collections
and the enforcement of our leases, I think we've done a really good job there.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And then, Jim, I wanted to ask about your comments in the prepared remarks around the embedded growth from leasing and the
sign that occupied pipeline. Notwithstanding some of the noise from out-of-period collections that you mentioned, Angela, are you
expecting to see minimum rent growth continue to improve into the fourth quarter from the 4.4% in the third quarter? And can you
provide some additional context around what you're anticipating for minimum rent growth heading into '23?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I appreciate the question and the focus on this point because it is important. So without giving specific guidance, what I will tell you is
that we do expect continued strength in top line growth. And it's being driven by that visibility on the signed but not occupied pipeline as
well as the forward pipeline. So if you think about it over a long period of time, we feel good that, that rent growth is going to trend
towards the upper end of the range.
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I would say on a year-to-date basis, our contribution from base rent growth, sort of stripping out the lease modification and
abatement number year-to-date is at 430 basis points. The guidance we've given earlier in the year was that for the full year, we'd be
somewhere between 400 and 500 basis points. So certainly, I do think you could see some acceleration in Q4 to get us to the midpoint of
that range. And as Jim said, we're very pleased with the signed but not commenced pipeline, the way that, that continues to deliver and
the leasing pipeline Jim mentioned in his remarks behind that.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Given the recent transaction activity, I was hoping you could provide some perspective on cap rates, especially curious on where cap rates
on grocery versus non-grocery assets are today and how they've moved here the last quarter? And could you provide or can you give the
cap rates for the $81 million you've sold here in early fourth quarter?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
We are seeing, Haendel, and I think it's true across the universe, a real slowdown in overall transaction activity. So data points are less
instructive, I think, in an environment of transition like this, everybody can point to a tight cap rate or a wider cap rate. With that said, I
think it's clear that there's upward pressure on cap rates even for the most core grocery-anchored shopping centers due to where the
tenure has gone and where the cost of finance has gone. I don't believe that, by the way, that movement is anywhere near as wide as the
movement in asset classes that are trading closer to that risk-free rate.
If you look at the cap rates that we achieved and what we've sold through the quarter and subsequent to the quarter, they're very
attractive. And in part, it's a testament to Mark and team finding liquidity from both smaller private buyers, [1031] buyers, et cetera, as
well as buyers looking at alternative uses for the properties such as what we capitalized on in College Park, Maryland. Mark?
 
Mark T. Horgan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. At least I would comment then, when you look at the market over the past few months, it's really been driven by a pretty wide
bid-ask spread between owners and sellers. So there's clearly demand for the asset class and people looking to buy. I think you're seeing
some owners say they're going to wait and see what happens in the rate environment, and that's really what's driving, I think, some of the
slowness in the market today.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Would you be willing to provide a cap rate on the $81 million in the fourth quarter so far?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean when I look at the pool of assets we sold subsequent to quarter end, there were, I believe, 5 shopping centers in that pool, 1
of which was sold for an alternative use at a very low cap rate. So the cap rate -- the blend on the $81 million subsequent to quarter end
is going to be below where you've seen us transact historically. But we prefer to wait and give cap rate on the full quarter once we give Q4
results.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Okay. Fair enough. And Angela, maybe one for you. It looks like the [SNO] spread widened 20 bps from last quarter, but the embedded
rent declined by about $1 million. So I guess, first off, I'm curious why the ABR within the SNO platform is decreasing a bit here while the
spread is expanding? Is that a mix issue? And then second, as you now said that historically high occupancies, is this SNO spread as good
as do you think it's going to get?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Sure. So there's a bit of a nuance between the spread between leased and billed occupancy and what we report in the signed but not
commenced pool. That's footnoted in the supplemental under that signed but not commenced table. And the delta really relates to
leases that have been signed and have not yet commenced on space that's currently in billed occupancy from the prior tenant, right? So
backfills of existing tenants.
So last quarter, the total signed but not commenced pool represented 420 basis points and included 70 basis points of space related to
tenants that were currently in billed occupancy, getting you down to that 350 basis point spread between leased and billed occupancy.
Today, we're still at 420 basis points in the signed but not commenced pool, but only 50 basis points of that is related to tenants that are
currently in occupancy. So more of the signed but not commenced pool -- even though the total number did not change, more of that
pool today is incremental than it was a quarter ago.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Got it. Got it. And are you seeing any delays -- sorry, just 1 last follow-up on just the [SNO] pipeline. Are you seeing any logjams forming
or still expect to get stores open next year in that SNO rent commenced on time?
 
Brian T. Finnegan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer
Haendel, this is Brian. Our team has done a great job of minimizing that. We certainly had some delays across the portfolio. But I think as
Jim talked about in his opening remarks and as we've talked about on prior calls, our operating teams are working very closely with
retailers. We found that our retail partners are being incredibly flexible in this environment, keeping existing HVAC units or keeping the
bathrooms in the locations where they're at, because they're incentivized to get these stores open, and we've had some great successes
year-to-date. And I think what we've been able to do has really positioned us go forward to negotiate those scopes upfront. So some of
the best practices we're learning will even take advantage of in a more normalized environment. So I think the team has done a great job.
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I would agree, and I would say what we're actually commencing in the quarter is exceeding our expectations. So we talked about the $14
million of rent that commenced this quarter, and the team is doing a phenomenal job of getting the tenants open in an occupancy. And
as you could imagine, we're absolutely aligned with the tenants in that regard. So as Brian highlighted, we and the tenants are working
together to get those stores open as quickly as possible.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Just thinking about occupancy. Curious what you see is reasonable -- reasonably achievable full occupancy, and I'm doing air quotes for
those not in the room with me, for the portfolio as it stands today. You've spoken about the 150 basis points of occupancy locked up in
the active redevelopment pipeline. But I'm curious how much more benefit is embedded in the future pipeline? And really kind of what do
you see as the low-hanging fruit left to fill in the near term?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Love the question and appreciate the air quotes. As we think about the plan, what we're excited about is that we continue to increase not
only occupancy, but potential occupancy for the portfolio. And so that's why you're seeing a set records today, but we still believe we
have room to run.
We believe we have room to run both in overall occupancy of a couple of hundred basis points but we also see it importantly in the high
rate, small shop component of our portfolio as well. So this strategy has had the follow-on benefit of increasing the potential occupancy
of this portfolio and that's something that's important to understand so that I fully see this portfolio hitting a stabilized occupancy above
what it's ever achieved in the past.
But another important thing to consider about this strategy, it's not simply about getting to full occupancy. It's about maximizing the ROI
on the assets that we have, recycling capital effectively, improving rate, driving NOI growth, in doing so in a value-added and disciplined
manner. It's a very granular strategy. But all you need to do is look at the metrics and results to see the success of it over time. So even in
a more full occupancy environment, this is a platform that will continue to create value as we recycle through opportunities that exist
throughout the portfolio to create value.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
And then just kind of just digging back on that. Do you have any thoughts on the future redevelopment pipeline and what might be
contributed from that in terms of occupancy?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I can't give you specific occupancy guidance on the future redevelopment pipeline. But when you look at it, we have another $400 million
underway, substantially leased, that's going to be a 9% to 10% incremental return. And then we have close to $1 billion of opportunity
beyond that, that we've identified in the properties that we'll get to as leases mature and give us the opportunity to recapture space and
drive the potential of those assets.
So we like that we've got several years of visibility of value-added activity even in an environment today where it's a self-funded and
internal growth-driven plan. I'm really pleased with what we've done with acquisitions that have been value added. Obviously, we're in an
environment today where I think it makes sense to pause. But we'll find in the future our openings to continue to grow in that regard as
well. But what I like about how we're positioned is we don't need that. We've got several years of runway of growth and opportunity that's
embedded in the assets that we own and control.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And Angela, if I could just follow up with how are you accounting for rent from Regal at this point?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. It's fair to say that all of our entertainment tenants or our movie theater tenants have been on cash basis through the pandemic. We
had 3 Regal locations at the time of filing. One was rejected, and we have 2 still in place. So we are recognizing revenue from all of our
movie theater tenants as cash is received.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Just hoping to go back to Craig's question on the redevelopments and maybe a comment you made about the rents you're getting there.
Do you expect that the yields you're targeting on those will increase as rents move higher? Or that the spread would maybe compress a
little bit, although still be positive and definitely better than traditional ground-up developments, just given a higher cost of capital in
today's environment with particularly higher interest rates?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. What we've seen and also on the cost side of the equation is, we're seeing it come through in terms of the cost to redevelop these
centers. But fortunately, we've been able to offset that with the rents that we're realizing on the reinvestment projects driven by the
tenant demand.
So again, we have pretty good visibility on continuing to be able to drive 9%, 10%, 11% incremental returns. Of course, the gross returns
are much higher. But -- and we think what we like about that is even in an environment of rising cap rates and rising interest rates, which
we've always underwritten, we're still creating significant value. Maybe not as much incremental value as when interest rates were in the
low-single digits, but we're still clearing it by a healthy margin. And importantly, we're setting these assets up for continued growth as
the balance of the assets benefit from the investments we're making.
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
I would also just add to that, that the risk associated with the type of redevelopment work we're doing continues to be very low. This is
very much, as Jim said earlier, a tenant-driven exercise. We're really not beginning projects. We have no capital at risk until we have
substantially all of the leases signed, all of the revenue kind of contractually obligated.
So when you think about that complexion from a risk standpoint against the returns we're achieving and where cap rates are today or
where they might go, I think that activity continues to be very attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up on foot traffic. Have you seen any bifurcation in foot traffic to your centers, if you cut your
portfolio into quartiles or what have you on different demographics or affluence levels? Have you seen any lower foot traffic for some of
your less affluent neighborhoods or anything to point out?
 
Brian T. Finnegan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer
Juan, no, this is Brian. It's actually been fairly broad-based across the portfolio, whether it's by region, whether it's by demographic.
We've been really encouraged by what we've seen in terms of consistent traffic growth both over last year and pre-pandemic. We've
obviously had some assets where we might have had a dark anchor and now that anchor is open where we're seeing growth. But also
interestingly, we've seen it from both grocery-anchored and non-grocery-anchored portfolio, which really makes us really encouraged
about what we're seeing in terms of the overall demand and traffic in centers.

Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I'm intrigued by this the signed not opened pipeline. As you know, Jim, not all spaces created equal and the upside potential here in your
small shop is actually more valuable than the anchored space. Could you quantify for us what 1% increase in small shop percent means
in terms of ABR?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Angela? Let us get back to you on that in terms of a specific quantum. But you're hitting on a very important point, which is the rents in
the small shops are higher. And we're driving benefit from that reinvestment, both in terms of occupancy and the small shop and rate.
And to that end, our in-process reinvestment pipeline is actually a drag on our occupancy, right? So we have real follow-on benefit for the
assets that were impacting. And we're seeing in those assets growth in the small shop occupancy of several hundred basis points, not to
mention rate.
But to something implicit, in the start of your question, we're creating huge value in the boxes, too. That's a lot of rent. And it's big
spreads. You're talking about spreads for us of 30%, 40%. So I'm excited about that, too. And when you look at the yields that we're
driving just on the absolute capital invested, repositioning anchors or repositioning portions of shopping centers, that's pretty
compelling. And the small shop is a great follow-on to the extent it's not included in what we originally touched.
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I can just say, Floris, we do give some good disclosure, I think, in the portfolio overview page in the sup about the different
components of the GLA and the portfolio and the rent on each of those buckets. But as your point sort of underscores while small shop is
a smaller portion of the portfolio, our small shop space only represents about 31% of our total GLA across the portfolio. Occupancy gain
in that smaller portion of the portfolio certainly has a disproportionate impact given that the rents in small shop, even in-place today are
$25 versus $16 for the portfolio overall.
So 100 basis point occupancy gain in that 31% of the portfolio translates into something more like a 50 or 60 basis point improvement in
our current ABR per foot. So higher than the 30 you would expect based on the composition of the portfolio.

Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Angela, I guess just a little bit more on the prior period rent collection at this time. I know that bucket was about $40 million, I think, in
the last quarter. It didn't really change this quarter. I guess just trying to understand better, I guess, the collectibility of that amount over
the next few quarters. Maybe provide some color on how many of those tenants are still active in your portfolio? Just trying to get a better
-- sort of trying to figure out what sort of upside you can see in your numbers coming from that in the coming quarters?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Thanks for the question, Samir. I'd say a couple of things. I kind of break it down this way. I would say about 1/3 of the $38 million
that we report that has been accrued for throughout the pandemic period, but uncollected and reserved for. So that's the number that
has theoretically the potential to be positive to the income statement were collected.
If you break that down into thirds, basically, I would say 1/3 of that $38 million, I would put a 0% probability on collecting. Those are
amounts that we've gone through the process, we've determined they're highly likely of being uncollected. We've written them off from a
balance sheet perspective. Another 1/3 of that relates to tenants that are -- have vacated the portfolio.
So the -- we continue to actively pursue all amounts outstanding. We're continuing to work with some of those prior tenants to get those
amounts collected. But clearly, the probability on that bucket is lower than on the 1/3 of the $38 million that relates to tenants that are
still active in the portfolio. So in terms of probability weighting, again, 1/3 relating to active tenants, higher probability, 1/3 relating to
tenants that have moved out but we're still pursuing; and then 1/3, I would put effectively a 0% probability on.
I would also say, just in terms of the granularity of that pool today, it is very small balances spread out across many, many tenants across
the portfolio. We no longer have some of the big, chunky national collections that we're still pursuing. Most of those have been fully
resolved to the company's benefit, to the company's favor. So it is much more difficult to predict the timing of when those amounts come
in. And I would say not only might we see some in 2022, maybe some in 2023. As I said in my remarks, we expect it to be pretty minimal
but those amounts will even stretch out past 2023. It's just -- it's becoming much more difficult to have good visibility on the timing of
those collections given the granularity.
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And when you think about the total rent during the pandemic period and the collection percentages that this company has achieved, it's
pretty impressive. And I think it stacks up against anybody. And I think that goes to the quality of our centers, the quality of our leases
and frankly, the focus of the team and making sure that we drive the collection of those prior period amounts.
But it is something, as Angela laid out very well, is a declining benefit as we look forward. So I'm real pleased with the cash flow that
we've been able to capture. And frankly, as Angela alluded to earlier, the strength of the tenancy in being able to pay some of those prior
period amounts, some of those deferrals, et cetera. But we're finally moving to the other side of that. And I think we fully expect, as
Angela said in her remarks, the benefit of that prior period collections to moderate significantly in the coming years.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Got it. And I guess just switching over to maybe the watch list for next year, right? Clearly, the pipeline is strong here from a leasing
perspective. You talked about the SNO pipeline. I guess help us understand what the level of fallout you could see, whether it's boxes or
shops. There's clearly been some noise in the news about some sort of retailers. But I'm just trying to frame out sort of the puts and takes
for next year as we think about growth, right, in '23, which is sort of the main focus for everybody in light of a pending slowdown.
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. And I appreciate the question. And we really tried to lay it out in our prepared remarks is we look at returning to a more normalized
level of tenant disruption as we look at the coming quarters. The tenants that we have on watch list wouldn't surprise anybody. And we're
watching them closely. And where we have any opportunities to recapture space, we're doing it and reducing our exposure to those
tenants as you would expect us to. I think an important thing to consider is if we do see a more normalization of tenant disruption, which
we fully expect and have incorporated into our outlook, who's well positioned to perform.
And this is where rent basis matters, right? So when you look at the in-place rents that we have and you look at where we've been signing
new rents, we have a lot of room to run. And you look at the discipline on capital, we're not buying these rents. So I like, again, the
all-weather nature of this plan and how it positions us to grow in a high-demand environment, such as the 1 we're in but also 1 that's
choppier. And I think it's logical to assume, and I think it's a good exercise for you to go through as we have an understanding of the puts
and takes as we look into '23 and beyond. And we're just really pleased with how we're positioned to grow. And the cumulative impact of
this reinvestment plan, we think will continue to shine.

Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So Angela, maybe just continuing on Samir's line of questioning, not asking for specific 2023 guidance, but you guys have discussed the
250 basis point headwind from back rents that were paid this year. There's also -- it sounds like Jim's comments normalization -- or
sorry, going to a normalized tenant credit loss. I don't know if that's maybe in that 50 to 100 basis point range.
But -- and then I think you guys are pretty good in the balance sheet. So not really too worried on floating rate exposure. But can you go
through some of the things that absolutely and in -- maybe in dollar amounts that we should be thinking about as we're updating our
models and thinking about 2023?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean I'd just go back to my prepared remarks, Alex, and the few things we mentioned, which, for the most part, I think you just
articulated. The first thing, I think, to really think about as it relates to 2023 is the out-of-period collection. As I mentioned, it's about $21
million of out-of-period collection. We've seen year-to-date in 2022. And that will absolutely act as a headwind to growth next year. And
so that's something to be mindful.
I've also said in my remarks, and you heard Jim reiterate it as well that we expect bad debt in total to look like historical levels. And our
historical run rate average has been somewhere between 75 and 100 basis points of deduct based on total revenue, 75 to 100 of total
revenues in any year for bad debt expense. We are coming off of a 2-year period really where revenues deemed uncollectible has been
positive to the income statement. That's obviously in the absence of prior period collections, not something anybody should be expecting
to continue going forward.
The balance sheet, as you mentioned, is in very good shape today. We don't have any debt maturities at this point until 2024 -- until June
of 2024. But I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a $200 million delayed draw term loan that we may utilize to continue to
extend duration across the balance sheet. And so those are some of the things to think about.
I think regardless of what the full picture looks like when we give complete guidance in the fourth quarter, I would just really emphasize,
as we talked about earlier, how strong the fundamental growth of the portfolio continues to be. As we're talking this year, the same
property guidance implies kind of 450 basis point contribution from base rent at the midpoint of the range. That's relative to the last high
watermark for the portfolio of 260 basis points. So the growth we're seeing in the current environment based on the strength of leasing
demand and based on the minimal amount of fallout we have had this year, certainly, can support as we look into 2023, a more
normalized level of tenant disruption activity while still putting up, as Jim underscored in his prior comments, very strong top line growth.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Okay. So just Angela, just to be clear then, the only real two things that we should be considering in our model is the $23 million of
catch-up rents that you got this year from COVID back pay; and then two, the normalized 75 to 100 bps bad credit, right? Those are the
only two big ones, right?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. That's all we've highlighted at this time, Alex.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Second question is for Brian Finnegan. We hear a lot from you and peers about retailers reengaging their store fleets after a
decade of e-comm-only focused, and whether it's last mile or just realizing that they need to focus more on capitalizing on the
resurgence of people shopping at shopping centers after the relocations during COVID.
Can you just give some tangible evidence or examples of where you've seen retailers shift dollars from e-comm to stores so that we have
this conceptually, but it'd be great to hear some actually real anecdotes that are material not just sort of one-offs?
 
Brian T. Finnegan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer
Yes. Sure, Alex. It's a great question. I think first, you'd start with Target, who has said, they're distributing 95% of their orders are coming
from their stores. And they said on multiple calls that the store is the center of what they do. And looking at taking a portion of those
stores for last mile fulfillment, you saw Walmart do the same thing at the start of the pandemic. And now that's flowing down into some
smaller retailers like junior boxes where you see an Ulta, for instance, is taking a portion of their store to allow for it.
We've talked about on prior calls, too, just the vast amount of retailers that are now doing curbside pickup. Prior to the pandemic, we had
mostly large format retailers and grocers. Now it's a wider range where they're interacting with the customer both in the store, taking the
most expensive part of the delivery out of it by having curbside pickup. So where we've really seen it though is in, I think some of those
small shop and junior anchored retailers like an Ulta, who is utilizing their space and their sales floor area a portion of it for last mile.
And I think it just points to the flexibility of the format, right? And the terms of you're seeing traffic that's being driven to the stores as
well as retailers continuing to be flexible. But I think for us, it's just really encouraging that we're seeing that investment in the stores.

Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Just wanted to follow up on the [SNO] pipeline, the progression. And I know it's up in '23, I think about $14 million sequentially. But just
from a timing perspective, can you just give a little bit of a sense of when that commences or like a time-weighted ABR for the year, just
some type of incremental color on how we should be kind of flowing that through the model?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. As I look at the 2023 commencement, so it's $32 million in total in 2023. At this point, it is pretty first half weighted as you would
expect it to be. As we continue to sign leases in the fourth quarter and early in 2023, you'll continue to see that second half number be
added to. But of the existing $32 million in that pipeline, it's pretty weighted to the first half of the year. It will be about $20 million to
$25 million in the first half.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. If we think about -- again, I know you guys aren't giving '23 guidance. But you talked about kind of the minimum rent growth for
this year and that I think 4% to 5% range. If you were able to maintain that level for next year, how much of that would be in the bag
given what you guys have kind of already in a signed not occupied bucket?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I think it's a bit of a tough question to answer. I think we have really good visibility on the signed but not commenced pool. Where we
end up in total is going to depend on things like tenant disruption, move-out activity, all the other things. So I think at this point, it's a
little bit of a hard question to answer. But I would just reiterate that I think the total size of the signed but not commenced pool, the
weighting as we described in 2023, the timing in 2023 is as high as it's been in a year, certainly. And I think that bodes really well for
growth overall.
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And it gives us a good bit of confidence. As we look into next year, we're not counting on significant speculative activity. We've done most
of the business already, which is always a good position to be in. And we're liking how we're seeing tenant demand and momentum
continue to build in our forward pipeline. So yes, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of one curiosity, I guess we talked earlier in the call about kind of 21% from the local tenants. But
how much of that bucket is like single kind of unit operator versus local guys who may have kind of multiple units and a little bit more of
the revenue base to win on in case the economy does weaken? I'm just trying to get a sense of the real credit profile of that local because
local kind of mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
 
Brian T. Finnegan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer
Yes. This is Brian. It's a bit of a mix. And I would point to some things we talked about on prior calls in terms of our underwriting
standards because coming out of the pandemic, our leasing teams partnered with Angela's group in finance to really tighten that up.
And what we've continued to see is strong multiunit operators and then also operators that are taking advantage of an environment
where there were some built-out restaurant vacancies. So there were some kind of move-in ready spaces.
So our credit profile is much better today, I'd say both from a local and a national perspective. But we're really excited about the depth
and quality of local tenants that we have. And as Jim kind of alluded to earlier in the call, those act as mini anchors to our centers.
They're unique businesses that really help cultivate a merchandising mix that we really like and help us -- help make those centers the
center of the communities they serve.
So I'd say, overall, our local tenant base is much stronger. And it has to do a lot with the work that our teams, both on the leasing and
finance side have done going to write those deals.

Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
So Jim, I think a lot of us on this call are trying to balance the good results that might be a little bit backwards looking versus some of the
macro concerns. And it does feel like after a couple of more bad data points, how does demand shift, that's probably the big question. So
when you look at the collective basket of conversations you're having for future leasing demand, how resilient do you think that -- those
conversations are if kind of the macro data points start to go south a little bit further?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
It's proven to be incredibly resilient. And one of the interesting things, Ki Bin, as you well know, is we're working with tenants on store
openings now that stretch into '24 and beyond. So the tenants are planning pretty far forward, understanding as everybody does, that we
may see some disruption in the coming year. I think one of the fundamental things that's important to appreciate is that these stores are
very profitable for the tenants. And they're a key part of their plans to serve the customer, and that's only proven to be more true.
And it's again, Ki Bin, I think, versus other environments, a supply-demand backdrop that's incredibly supportive for landlords. There's
virtually no new supply. So as we have calls with national, regional and local tenants alike and meetings, we remain very encouraged by
the breadth of that demand, as I talked about and the depth of it. And the position that it puts us in as a landlord to continue to drive
rate.
So while certainly, our results to-date are a factor of what we've done, I think what's also important -- or important to appreciate is how
what we've done sets us up to be pretty confident in terms of where we're going to be over the next several quarters even with the
moderation in tenant demand. I don't see it. We haven't seen it yet, but we've always prepared ourselves for an all-weather environment.
It's part of our exacting standards on capital allocation. It's part of the follow-on benefits that we've been willing to harvest and discipline
around capital recycling.
So I like how we're positioned. I like how we're positioned to perform particularly on a relative basis, again, given our rent. So the strength
of the tenant demand remains really robust. The supply-demand picture really favors our asset class. Our traffic levels continue to
remain strong and elevated. And we, in particular, are benefiting from a value-added reinvestment program that's transforming the
portfolio.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. And second question, what are you expecting from the Kroger‚Äôs Albertsons merger and any type of store closures within your
portfolio that we should expect?
 
Brian T. Finnegan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer
Ki Bin, this is Brian. Look, this is going to be a long process. I think the companies have given themselves throughout 2024. There's a big
regulatory process that they have to go through. I would just say that we feel really strong about both our Kroger and Albertsons fleets.
We've got great partnerships with both of those retailers, great well-performing locations throughout the Southeast, places like Texas,
Southern California, Denver. We have a very strong Kroger portfolio in the Midwest.
And some of you on the call have mentioned, we have one of the lowest overlaps in the sector of these 2 companies. So it's something
that we are closely watching, and we'll continue to monitor, but really early innings for that. And no matter the outcome, we feel really
good about our fleets.
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And that's well done by the productivity of these stores. So not only do we have low overlap, our store sales numbers are very strong.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
And what does that low overlap mean?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
What you look at is the number of stores that you have competing with each other within a 5-mile radius as stores that may be impacted
by the combination, either in terms of required divestitures or potential store closures as the 2 chains consider what they want to do from
a strategy perspective. There's a long regulatory road ahead. And as Brian said, this will take time to play out. But we like how we're
positioned, both on an absolute basis, given the productivity of the stores as well as a relative basis given the limited degree of overlap
our portfolio has.

Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Angela, I was wondering, can you walk through how you think about, I guess, the balance sheet leverage and funding redevelopments
next year in a scenario where the disposition market still may be sketchy and you don't like your stock price?
 
Angela M. Aman
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. I would say, based on the significant amount of free cash flow we generate, we can continue to
fund 100% of our redevelopment activity on a leverage reducing basis. If we use that free cash flow and a little bit of incremental
leverage, debt-to-EBITDA comes down as we execute on that program, given that it's substantially funded with free cash flow.
So we're really not -- as Jim sort of mentioned earlier, we're not beholden to the disposition market or the public equity market in terms
of continuing to fund the portfolio transformation efforts and generate those very attractive 9% to 11% incremental returns.
 
Operator
Next question is from Paulina Rojas with Green Street.
 
Paulina A. Rojas-Schmidt
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Analyst of Retail
I'm trying to have a sense of what economics behind getting a box back in the current environment. And I can see in your disclosure that
the -- during the last 12 months, the average ABR for new anchored leases being around $15 per square foot. How much lower is that
number after CapEx on a net effective basis? I know you have some disclosure...
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
It depends on the plan to backfill. So if it's a consistent use, your capital per foot over a 10-year basis can be a couple of bucks a foot. If
it's a situation where you're coming back and you're dividing the box for 2 junior anchored tenants, your rent spreads can be much more
significant and cover the capital that would be required. And that's, Paulina, really, the basis and the important part of this question is
because it does take capital to bring in a new tenant and we show you what those net effective rents are. It does take capital to divide a
box, what is your going in rents.
And so when you're coming off a rent, it's $8, $9, $10 and you're dealing with the new rent that's $16 or higher, you have the ability on a
net effective basis to be positive, not to mention the ROI. So that's -- it depends on the box itself. What we do in addition to disclosing our
net effective rents is, we show you what the returns are across our reinvestment activity. And then every quarter, we show you what we
delivered, and that's really, I think the litmus test for us in terms of whether or not we're creating value and the repurposing of the box.
 
Paulina A. Rojas-Schmidt
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Analyst of Retail
How much would you say the CapEx is in a worst-case scenario where you need to bring in another use and maybe split the box in 2
today?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Again, it depends. You could spend $40 a foot. You could spend $70 a foot, $80 a foot, even more depending on what you're doing with
the box. If you're coming back with a similar use, you can be below that. If you're dividing the box up, say, you're taking a large box and
you're making a small shop, you could be at the upper end of that range. And again, the decision as to what to do with that box is going
to be driven by what we believe is right for the center, but also what we think is going to maximize ROI. And that comes through in those
reinvestment yields that we show you.
 
Paulina A. Rojas-Schmidt
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Analyst of Retail
And then last question. I know you have no expirations in the near term. But can you talk about how you perceive, how restrictive or
extensively perceive bank and CMBS financing for the shop center as for today?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
No, it's interesting. I think what's happening in the capital markets is clearly we're going through a reset. I don't think levels have found
normalcy yet. Not only with respect to the base rate but also importantly, with respect to spreads. And the other thing that you have
going on, Paulina, right now is constrained liquidity. So you have many lenders who have pulled back in terms of providing debt capital
or where they do, it's pretty high-cost debt capital. That will work itself through.
But even in that environment, I do think you have private landlords that have upcoming debt maturities who've been reliant perhaps on
low interest rates to recapitalize, refinance and take equity out of assets. That's going to present some interesting opportunities as those
maturities come due in a higher interest rate environment. And that's where we think our advantage is as a national platform with access
to understanding tenant demand, the ability to redevelop and reposition boxes and importantly, the track record to do so and also the
liquidity to capitalize on it.
So we're excited about the potential for that opportunity coming out of this disruption. We're not pounding the table and saying it
absolutely will happen. But it feels to me like we're setting up for a very attractive, cyclical redeployment period.

Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
I know earlier on you emphasized you don't need acquisitions to still put up a very strong earnings outlook. But I am curious what kind of
the signals you are looking for before you feel more confident about the transactions market? Is it more just cap rates backing up 150,
200 basis points? Is it more of you guys feeling you have a better sense of your cost of capital? Just kind of curious what would make you
kind of get back on that horse?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I think it's a little bit of both those things. One, you want to see where cost of capital is settling out. But also perhaps even more
important than cap rate or equally important to cap rate is that you're finding opportunities to truly grow ROI and achieve very attractive
unlevered returns even in an environment such as the one we're in.
So I think it will become clear as the market evolves. I just think we're in a transition period right now, and the wise thing to do is to be
patient because I think opportunities are going to move our way from a return perspective.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Got you. And then just kind of what you're seeing in regards to a lot of the shopping center names, you're trading at big discounts to NAV.
Just curious what your thoughts are in regards to another round of consolidation in the industry as we saw a few years ago with some of
the merger of equals that happened back then?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
It's certainly something that happens in cycles, and we could see platforms combining in part because there's certainly benefits to having
scale, such as we have in dealing with landlords -- or excuse me, in dealing with tenants. So I think you could see some additional
consolidation, particularly amongst some of the smaller platforms that don't have the scale or efficiency or liquidity. But we'll see. I think
it's something that's often predicted and doesn't occur quite as often as it's predicted.

Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
I have a similar question. Could you comment on the renewed and slightly expanded share repurchase authorization and how that could
rank in your priorities in the next several quarters?
 
James M. Taylor
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - CEO, President & Director
We're always trying to make the best and most appropriate capital allocation decisions. And so as Angela highlighted in her remarks, the
shelf really gives us a battery pack for our tools as we move forward. Not a statement that we're going to use it or not use it, but we
always want to have those tools available to us as with every other tool necessary that we think can drive our growth as an enterprise.
But again, I think what's important here to appreciate is what Angela highlighted before, which is we have a self-funded plan generated
and driven by opportunities embedded in the assets that we own, that we believe is going to deliver growth towards the top of the peer
group. We like that. We like that it's not dependent upon where the capital markets might be at a particular point in time or the
availability of attractively priced acquisitions or attractively priced dispositions.
It's a plan that we think is all weather. And again, it's driven by opportunities that we control and funded by free cash flow, as Angela
highlighted, on a leverage -- deleveraging basis. So we like that. But I think as we've demonstrated over the last 6-plus years that we've
been part of this team, we will be opportunistic with capital and step into those situations that we think really enhance long-term
shareholder value.

Maybe one more like how labor staffing levels at your centers to the best of your knowledge, are most of the stores fully staffed or
appropriately staffed and how has that trended across the year? And do you think maybe a looser labor market in the next few quarters
should help the store opening accelerate?
 
Brian T. Finnegan
Brixmor Property Group Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Revenue Officer
Yes. This is Brian. We've seen that improve a bit. I think retailers, it's something that I think the entire market that was grappling this year
over the past few quarters. But I think we've seen that stabilize a bit. Retailers are very excited about the store openings this year in our
discussions with our retail partners, incredibly focused on getting those stores in and open ahead of holidays and even working outside
what typically would be blackout windows, pushing those out. There were periods where they didn't want to get very close to
Thanksgiving, but they're really focused on getting those stores open and having those stores fully staffed. So we've seen that certainly
improve. And I think a good signal of that from our retail partners is that focus on getting a lot of those stores open this year.
