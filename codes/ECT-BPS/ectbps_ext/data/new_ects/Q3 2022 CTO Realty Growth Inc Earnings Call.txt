Welcome to CTO Realty Growth, Inc. Q3 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to hand the conference over to your
speaker today, Matt Partridge, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the CTO Realty Growth Third Quarter 2022 Operating Results
Conference Call. With me today is our CEO and President, John Albright.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of our comments today are considered forward-looking statements under federal
securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking
statements, and we undertake no duty to update these statements. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially
from expectations are disclosed from time to time in greater detail in the company's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. You can
find our SEC reports, earnings release, supplemental and most recent investor presentation on our website at ctoreit.com.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our team's strong execution during the third quarter across all
phases of our business. We opportunistically sold several legacy properties, including our multi-tenanted office property. And as we
discussed during our last earnings call, we invested it into our first public-anchored asset, Madison Yards in Atlanta, Georgia. We also
completed a number of capital markets transactions that fortified our balance sheet, continue to have good success with our leasing
initiatives and drove more than 36% year-over-year AFFO growth during the quarter. On top of it all, we had a nice start to the fourth
quarter with our acquisition of West Broad Village in Richmond, Virginia, which is a very high-quality property that we believe has great
long-term upside.
If you look at our transaction activities over the past 4 months, we found some excellent grocery anchor opportunities as we continued
our portfolio repositioning efforts by taking advantage of the disruption in the market and executing on strategic asset recycling. During
the quarter, we sold 245 Riverside our loan remaining office property in Jacksonville, Florida. And we also sold 2 single-tenant assets in
our master lease property outside of Miami and Haile, Florida for a total disposition volume of $57 million at a 6.3% blended exit cap
rate. These disposition proceeds and the proceeds from our asset sales during the first half of the year, effectively match funded our
purchase of Madison Yards.
As we've highlighted in the past, the 162,500 square foot property sits on a great infill location along the belt line in Atlanta, Georgia. It
was an opportunity to enhance our portfolio's tenant quality while also improving our geographic exposure by further investing in
Atlanta, which we believe is one of the best markets in the country. The asset has excellent stable cash flow, a terrific customer draw in
public and represents a great core property that has set the benefit from the rapid pace of growth of the Inman Park and rental
submarket and the long-term prospects of the broader Atlanta area.
West Broad Village, which is our most recent acquisition that we acquired 2 weeks ago, spans more than 392,000 square feet on 33
acres and has some similar characteristics, including a very strong grocer in Whole Foods as well as a great complementary retail tenants
and REIT, Dave & Buster's and HomeGoods. We acquired this property meaningfully below replacement costs with 17% vacancy, which
we believe provides us upside as we emphasize value-added leasing and look to reposition the asset as a dominant lifestyle property in
the high-end short pump submarket of Richmond, Virginia.
Overall, if we take a step back and look at how our portfolio has evolved since the beginning of the year, we've been able to trade out of
office and single-tenant assets and reinvest into properties anchored by tenants such as Whole Foods, HomeGoods, Publix, REIT, raw
stress roles and Best Buy, while further diversifying our overall tenant exposure and giving our portfolio more long-term upside through
lease-up of acquired vacancy and re-tenanting units that currently have below market rents as they become available.
We've been able to drive attractive net investment spreads while also more than doubling our grocery-anchored asset exposure to nearly
30% of the portfolio and increasing our overall retail and mixed-use portfolio make up to nearly 90%. While we're excited about these
new investments, we're also highly focused on maximizing the value of our existing portfolio through active asset management, leasing
and our capital investment program.
We're starting to see the benefits of the leases we've signed over the past few quarters with new leases beginning to open at a number of
our properties. The most notable gains have occurred at Ashford Lane, where nearly a dozen new tenants have opened or will open over
the next few months. The property is currently 78% occupied and more than 85% leased. And with the progress we've made on the line,
we have a strong tailwind to fill the remaining unleased vacancy to drive additional revenue in the next 12 to 24 months.
The operational gains are not just through revenue growth, we're also finding ways to operate the properties more efficiently. The
combination of the 2 resulted in year-over-year store NOI growth of 12% in the quarter and is up more than 20% year-to-date. From a
leasing perspective, we signed 7 new leases in the quarter, totaling 43,000 square feet at an annual average rent of over $36 per square
foot. More than half of this lease square footage is for existing vacancy acquired when we purchased the property and the largest of the
new leases signed at our property in Winter Park, Florida, where we now lease the entire top floor.
2 of the new leases were in locations where the tenant either vacate the property or relocated them to a previously vacant unit. In these
instances, we grew expiring rents by 47%. Of our 9 renewals and extensions during the quarter, we experienced nearly 8% growth in
comparable new per square foot lease rates as we continue to benefit from meaningful tenant demand for our high-quality locations.
Within our structured investments portfolio, we anticipate the borrower of Water Star loan to fully repay the outstanding balance before
the end of the year, which will allow us to pay down debt until we find new additional opportunities for reinvestment.
All of our successes are not without some challenges. We've been notified that the WeWork location at our shop at legacy property in
Plano, Texas will be going dark before the end of the year. We have a corporate guarantee in place that should take the anticipated plan
needed to find a replacement tenant. While we recognize it will take some time and effort to find the right tenant, we believe we can find
a productive backfill that will benefit the property given the strength of the market.
Additionally, we do have 1 Regal theater in the portfolio at our Beaver Creek Crossings property outside of Raleigh, North Carolina. We've
been in dialogue with their representatives, and they are currently no indications that our lease will be rejected in bankruptcy. However,
given that the box is separately parceled in the Raleigh market is one of the fastest growing, most in-demand markets in the country, we
believe we have an attractive set of alternatives available to us should they decide to vacate the space.
Finally, on the capital investment side of things, the lawn at Ashford Lane is largely complete, and we expect that the space to be fully
operational and activated as we head towards the holiday season.
I'll now pass it over to Matt to talk about our performance in the quarter, capital markets activities and increased guidance.
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thanks, John. With the inclusion of West Broad Village, our income property portfolio consists of 19 properties, comprising approximately
3.1 million square feet of rentable space across 15 markets. Our largest markets are now Atlanta, Georgia, Dallas, Texas, Richmond,
Virginia and Raleigh, North Carolina, where we've seen strong tenant demand, excellent population growth and above average wage
growth. Fidelity continues to be our largest tenant exposure, but with the shift in portfolio make-ups that John talked about, we've added
a number of high-quality retail tenants to our top 20 tenant list, and we've nearly finalized our transition to retail and mixed-use assets.
At quarter end, our portfolio was 92% occupied, and we reported leased occupancy of more than 94%. Total revenues for the third
quarter increased nearly 40% to $23 million, and year-to-date total revenues have increased by 31% to $60 million. In the $6.5 million
year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues, $4.5 million was driven by income property and structured investment revenue gains, while
the other $2 million was from mitigation credit and subsurface sales.
Our year-over-year same-property NOI growth for the quarter was 12%, with Crossroads Town Center in Chandler, Arizona, the strand in
Jacksonville, Florida, and our restaurants in Daytona Beach, representing the largest contributions to the growth. Our same-property
NOI statistics only include assets owned for the entirety of the measurement period in both 2022 and 2021 to the effects of the properties
we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021 and year-to-date 2022 do not impact these results for the quarter.
Third quarter 2022 core FFO was $0.47 per share, representing a 38% increase compared to the third quarter of 2021. And third quarter
2022 AFFO was $0.49 per share, representing a 36% increase over the third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date, core FFO was $1.41 per share
and AFFO was $1.47 per share, representing a year-over-year per share growth of 55% and 41%, respectively, when compared to the first
9 months of 2021.
The third quarter was the first quarter our convertible notes. On an if-converted basis, under Accounting Standards Update 2020-06
resulted in a dilutive impact to our earnings per share. As a result, we adjusted net income per share and NAREIT defined FFO per share
to remove the interest expense associated with our convertible notes, and we added approximately 3.1 million shares to our diluted
weighted average share count to reflect the impact of our convertible notes as if they were converted at the current conversion ratio as of
the end of the third quarter.
We reversed these adjustments for our calculation of core FFO per share and AFFO per share in order to reflect the actual incurred
interest expense and current basic share count as reflected on the face of our P&L. We did not make this adjustment for our year-to-date
net income per share and NAREIT defined FFO per share because the effects of the adjustments would be anti-dilutive.
We'll continue to evaluate whether or not the adjustments required under ASU 2020-6 will be dilutive or antidilutive in each subsequent
quarter and we'll adjust our net income per share in NAREIT defined FFO per share accordingly. Because we removed the effects from
our core FFO per share and AFFO per share, the impact does not influence our guidance or the comparability of those quarterly and
year-to-date results to our guidance.
As previously announced, the company paid a third quarter regular cash dividend of $0.38 per share on September 30 to shareholders of
record on September 12. Our quarterly dividend represents a 14% year-over-year increase over the company's Q3 2021 cash dividend and
a 1.8% increase over our Q2 2022 quarterly cash dividend and a current annualized yield of approximately 7.6%. This represents a Q3
2022 AFFO per share cash payout ratio of 78%.
On the capital markets front, it was an active quarter. As we previously discussed in July, we completed our 3-for-1 stock split effective
July 1. Within the quarter, we issued approximately 566,000 shares of common stock through our ATM program for total net proceeds of
$12.3 million at an average issuance price of $22.02 per share. We refinanced our credit facility, extending the maturity date of our
revolver to January 2027 and increased the commitments by $90 million to a total size of $300 million. We also entered into a new $100
million term loan with an expiration date of January 2028, and we fully swapped the term loan effectively fixing SOFR for the life of the
loan.
We have a terrific support from the bank market during these 2 transactions, so I'd like to acknowledge and thank all of our banking
partners for their commitment to our strategy and our team. And finally, we repurchased approximately 86,000 shares of common stock
for $1.6 million at a weighted average gross price of $19.17 per share. We ended the quarter with approximately $47 million of cash and
restricted cash and approximately $262 million of undrawn commitments under our revolving credit facility. Net debt to total enterprise
value at quarter end was approximately 43%, and our net debt to EBITDA was 6.4x.
Looking at the balance of the year, we revised our full year 2022 guidance to account for our Q3 2022 results and revised expectations
for transaction and leasing activity and current capital markets environment, a steepening yield curve and other influential assumptions.
Our new core FFO per share guidance range is $1.71 to $1.74 per share, which is an increase of $0.13 per share at the low end and $0.10
per share at the high end. Our new AFFO per share guidance range of $1.79 to $1.82 per share, which is an increase of $0.09 per share at
the low end and $0.06 per share at the high end. Our revised guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or structured investments for
the balance of the year. Furthermore, we have revised our disposition guidance to a range of $81 million to $83 million of property sales
at an exit cap rate of 6.2%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to John for his closing remarks.
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Matt. This was a great quarter of execution regardless of some of the challenges at hand. We believe our rock-solid balance
sheet, strong market, high-quality portfolio and embedded same-store NOI growth from our year-to-date and future leasing activity have
us well positioned to continue delivering outsized earnings and cash flow growth through the end of the year and for the foreseeable
future.
We appreciate all of our team's hard work, and I want to thank our investors and partners for their continued support.
With that, we will open it up for questions. Operator?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Gaurav Mehta from EF Hutton.
 
Gaurav Mehta
EF Hutton, Research Division - Research Analyst
I was hoping if you could provide some color on what you guys are seeing in the transaction market as far as cap rates?
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. So it's kind of interesting. There's not a lot of activity going on right now with regards to transactions because there's a little bit of a
standoff between buyers and sellers. And people that obviously is a challenging environment if you're looking to sell a property because
there's really no debt market for secured debt. So if you're out in the market trying to sell something, you probably have to sell
something. And I would say that roughly on those sort of situations, kind of like us, people only want a really good deal. So I'd say cap
rates are out like 100 basis points or more depending on the kind of quality of the property. But so right now, there's not a lot of
transactions happening. There's probably less inventory out there being sold because people are determining this not a great time to be
selling an asset.
 
Gaurav Mehta
EF Hutton, Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. Maybe second question, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a few times about strong tenant demand. I was hoping if
you could maybe provide some color on-- have you seen any sign of weakness or softness from your tenants or demand continues to
remain strong for your properties?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. We keep on -- we expect it to soften up. It hasn't softened up. The only softness we've seen and heard about is really from local
tenants in the markets where our properties are located, but the more national regional tenants, the demand is still strong.
 
Operator
And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney Montgomery Scott.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
John, can you talk a little bit about where the rent is on the WeWork space versus market and how much term is left on that lease?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. So roughly, there's definitely 8 or 9 years left on term and the rent is probably $2 above market. So the opportunity there will be
getting -- going after the guarantee and what's owed and then bringing in another tenant. And there's been -- the words already kind of
gotten out in the market, even though they haven't really done any sort of official notice and there's -- we've had a bunch of operators
that want to take over the space.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Sort of similar co-working type of thing?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Correct.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
And then given your comments on Regal at your Raleigh location, I mean do you want them to stay? Is it better for you longer term if they
go if they turn back in the lease and you could do something else with the space? I mean how far down the road have you guys gotten in
terms of game planning, what winds up happening if Regal leaves?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I mean, I would say that, look, I think Regal in that location is a really nice use because it's a very neighborhood kind of a community
center. It was very activated for families that live around there. So I think it's a nice complement. But if they decide that it's done work for
them, we do have great alternatives. So it's just a lot more work to make that happen because it's not going to be using the theater box
or lease. We wouldn't pursue another theater. We pursue an alternate use, which is better credit and that sort of thing. So which those
uses would be nice complements as well, but I just think the theater actually works pretty well for the center.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
And then how is AMC doing in the new Atlanta asset and any of the other movie theaters that you guys have, are you concerned about at
this point?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. So AMC at Madison Yards, I mean that's one of their newest theaters probably in the country. I mean, it opened up right before
pandemic, and it's not super large, and they've been very consistent, at least when the new shows like Top Gun and everything came
around, it was very strong. I suspect without any kind of banner sort of movies coming out right now, it's probably slipped off a little bit.
But the center is so packed with people that if there's a good theater and there's so many people live around our good show, and there's
a lot of people live around there, it would be a hassle to go to a movie somewhere else just because of the traffic in Atlanta. So it has a
nice capture audience there. And again, it's only 8 screens. So it's not an enormous project.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
And then, Matt, is there any material delay in terms of some of the leases that you signed and when they start flowing through the top
line? Just trying to reconcile a little bit the difference between third quarter FFO or core FFO and the fourth quarter implied guidance.
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes, there is. I mean, there's about $2.3 million, $2.4 million of rent that's been signed that hasn't commenced. And that's all on space
that's currently not cash flowing. So there's some pretty good tailwind heading into next year that will come online probably late fourth
quarter, whereas maybe originally, we thought it was early fourth quarter. So there's been some timing delays on certain things. We had
a few pull up into the third quarter as well. So they're constantly moving around.
 
Operator
And our next question comes from Matthew Erdner from Jones Trading.
 
Matthew Erdner
JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC, Research Division - Research Associate
Matthew on for Jason. Congrats on the good quarter. Could you provide an update of the leasing efforts at Ashford Lane?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Ashford Lane has been incredibly busy. We're in a great situation there in that we've signed a restaurant tenant for the last
remaining space at the lawn, and we'll be moving that tenant that's there now to the second floor office space. So we kind of -- we've
upgraded that use in a much higher paying tenant. And then we're getting -- we're leasing office vacancy with relocating the existing
tenant. And then we've had another lease sign this week, kind of smaller tenants. So -- and we have 2 or 3 other leases in the works right
now. So it feels really good that this one is going to be kind of fully stabilized by the end of the year or first quarter next year. But there
could be a situation where we just kind of wait for the right tenant on some of the spaces that are left. But yes, everything has been very
strong there.
 
Matthew Erdner
JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC, Research Division - Research Associate
And then in terms of asking rents, what are the expectations on increases, I guess, there? And then for next year if you guys have any
coming online?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Matt, you want to...
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
When you say expectations of increases, are you talking about relative to replacing existing rents that might be expiring?
 
Matthew Erdner
JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC, Research Division - Research Associate
Yes.
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean, in the quarter, we only had 2 lease -- new leases that we signed that were replacing existing tenants, and those were up
47%. But that's probably not a good expectation for next year, but that gives you a sense of the strength of the market and the quality of
the assets and where rents are headed.
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I mean there's some that are double because the tenants that have been there, have been there for a while and that submarket has just
gotten so much denser. So the anything that has a tenant that's been there while the uplift on it is pretty strong.
 
Operator
And our next question comes from Craig Kucera from B. Riley Securities.
 
Craig Gerald Kucera
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
John, given the challenges that developers are finding in the debt markets, in particular, are you seeing more opportunities that you
might move forward on in your structured investment portfolio?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
The answer is yes, Craig. I mean, there are some good opportunities that seem to be starting to percolate. And we can earn equity like
yields of being in a first mortgage or med situation. We don't have anything kind of right in front of us that we're going to be printing a
ticket anytime soon. But I will say that, that area should be very active for the rest of the year.
 
Craig Gerald Kucera
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
And Matt, your G&A expense was a little higher this quarter, I think, higher than expend at some time. And I'm just curious, were there
any onetime expenses affiliated with the corporate move to Orlando or should we expect that to be more of a recurring level due to some
staffing increases and maybe some additional office expense?
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. No, no onetime items, just continuing to build out the team as we bring on more managed assets and build out about the
infrastructure.
 
Craig Gerald Kucera
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
And can you give me some color on the -- I think you have about a 350 basis point delta between what you've leased and economic
occupancy. How are you thinking about the pace of when those leases will take occupancy and start paying cash over the next year or so?
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I think there's a handful of them that will come online between now and the end of the year, and then there's another handful that
will come online in the first quarter, but some of these will take a little bit longer into the, I'll call it, the middle of next year to come
online just because the tenants have to do their build-out. So there's a free rent period and things like that.
 
Craig Gerald Kucera
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
And just one more for me. I'd be curious, you had some success selling mitigation credits and monetizing some of those types of noncore
assets. Were those utilized by standard developers and can you talk about sort of the market for sales right now in that piece of your
business?
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. So that was for basically development projects that are still going forward, and we expect some additional sales that happen
probably at the very end of the year or maybe slip over into January. It seems like everything's kind of slipping. But projects, we haven't
heard a project kind of being shelved because of the environment. I think Florida has that unique kind of tailwind for needs for the
development. So, so far, so good.
 
Operator
And our next question comes from R.J. Milligan from Raymond James.
 
Unidentified Analyst
This is [John Paul] on for R.J. If you guys did $0.47 of core FFO in 3Q, which comes out to around $1.88 annualized, which is above
consensus for 2023. Just curious if there are any onetime items in that 3Q number and how we should think about the run rate going
forward?
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Good to hear from you, John Paul. I think in Q3, we had the interest expense from some of the structured investments that will get
paid off this quarter and then as we head into the first quarter of next year. And so either those proceeds will be used to pay down debt or
to John's point, we might find some other opportunities on the financing side to put that capital back to work. So it's a little uncertain on
the redeployment side for that as capital. And then we had some accrual true-ups and some percentage rent in the third quarter, which
we're hopeful the percentage rent will continue, but it will obviously be performance driven by the tenants. But I think we're not in a
position yet to provide formal guidance for next year, but the $1.88 run rate certainly seems appropriate as a starting point.
 
Unidentified Analyst
And then additionally, my other question was on leverage. It looks like it ticked down to 6.4x this quarter. Just wondering if you could
remind us of your leverage targets and how you expect to kind of manage the balance sheet moving into next year?
 
Matthew Morris Partridge
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. So it did tick down. But I'll remind everybody that we did bring it back up a little bit to fund a portion of the West Broad acquisition in
October. I think you can expect us to run it in that 6x to 7x range, but we could end up a low or above it, just given the size of the
company, it doesn't take a lot to move it. The other thing I'd highlight is that with the convertible notes, the conversion price is below the
stock price today. And so that's $50 million of debt that will likely convert to equity in 2025. So from sort of a pro forma leverage
perspective, accounting for that, we're pretty under levered relative to our long-term targets.
 
Operator
And our next question comes from Michael Gorman from BTIG.
 
Michael Patrick Gorman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD & REIT Analyst
John, I was wondering -- sorry if I missed it, but you talked about the pause in the acquisition markets, which certainly makes sense and
something we're seeing across property types. I wonder what your sense is for kind of what -- where the market would clear right now
versus maybe 90 days ago or even 6 months ago, right? Because we keep hearing there's a ton of dry powder. On the private side, REIT
balance sheets are in pretty good shape. Certainly, ours is as well and are looking for opportunities. So I'm kind of curious to your
thoughts on what it would take for the market to start clearing in terms of price adjustments?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. So I think that, again, it's probably 100 basis points if you're talking about like a power center, it could be higher, it could be 125, 150
basis points to clear. But if you're talking about high-quality grocer-anchored, you're probably talking about 50 basis points to 75 basis
points. I just got back from ULI and that was kind of a discussion around with a lot of different sorts of owners and buyers in capital, and
that was the consensus that if you have a really high-quality grocer deal, you're probably seeing 50 to 75 basis points.
But if you're kind of power center, you're 100, 150 basis points, something like that. So in this environment, we're definitely kind of
looking for those really good opportunities where you can take advantage of the dislocation, but you don't want to buy something that's
just marginally, you really want something that's high quality kind of like what we just bought in West Broad.
 
Michael Patrick Gorman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD & REIT Analyst
And then either John or Matt, just talking about the share repurchases in the quarter. I understand it was a relatively small amount and it
was below where the stock is today, which is always a good sign. But I'm just curious how you balance that out versus the longer-term
growth trajectory of the company and the liquidity in the shares balancing -- taking advantage of an opportunity where the stock is
clearly mispriced versus that long-term liquidity and long-term capital base?
 
John P. Albright
CTO Realty Growth, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I mean, look, we've been very active in share repurchases when it makes sense throughout the time I've been here. And so we're
always really looking about always driving accretion to NAV. So we don't worry about so much liquidity and growth of the company so
much. We're just really about driving NAV and value. And so -- but we hope that we will get those opportunities to grow the company.
And given the growth we have on these results and what we have kind of the tailwinds we have with the portfolio, we feel pretty good
about where the company is going to be next year.
So why not take advantage of the stock the market for CTO has always been a bit of a lagger from -- just because we're just not as well
covered. So we're just -- we feel like we're -- even though we've been around 115 years, we feel like we're still a new company because
people -- some people haven't heard of us, and they're starting to learn more about us. and as we continue to upgrade our portfolio.
So I know I'm giving you a really full winded answer. But -- so we'll always take advantage of dislocations in the market when there's
volatility and people are seeking liquidity and panicking. But we'll -- as you saw in the quarter, also, we did issue some shares. So just
taking advantage of dislocations and when it presents itself.
