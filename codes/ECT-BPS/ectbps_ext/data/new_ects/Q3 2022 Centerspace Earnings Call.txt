Centerspace - VP of Finance and IR
Center space's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, was filed with the SEC yesterday after the market closed.
Additionally, our earnings release and supplemental disclosure package have been posted to our website at centerspacehomes.com and
filed on Form 8-K.
It's important to note that today's remarks will include statements about our business outlook and other forward-looking statements
that are based on management's current views and assumptions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in
our Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2021, under the section titled Risk Factors and in our other filings with the SEC.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will materialize, and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings release for reconciliations of any non-GAAP information, which may be
discussed on today's call. I'll now turn it over to Mark Decker for the company's prepared remarks.
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me this morning is Anne Olson, our Chief Operating Officer; and
Bhairav Patel, our Chief Financial Officer. Strong fundamentals continue in the rental housing business and 2022 will likely go down as
one of the best years on record. Against that backdrop, Centerspace has performed well, and I'm delighted to report that core FFO per
share is up 17% quarter-over-quarter and 11% year-to-date.
I'm also happy to share that our guidance for the full year is for at least 10% core FFO growth, and the top line story remains
encouraging. The capital markets have been volatile with a 10-year up over 130 basis points since we last got together or almost 50%
from mid-2s to over 4%. The speed of this move paired with the continued inflation in materials and labor as well as a return to
pre-COVID seasonality have caused us to trim our guidance from August.
Finding ways to contain costs and improve processes while maintaining strong customer service is the top focus for us today. All that
said, if we zoom out a little, Centerspace has an outstanding business and the housing we provide meets the basic need. Our business is
remarkably consistent as represented by 2022 being our fourth straight year of same-store NOI and per share core FFO growth. But we
do believe profitability and efficiency remain an opportunity to improve and drive value, and it's one of our key strategic pillars to do so. I
know we can.
Turning to investments. We've been more active over the last few months than we were for most of the year. We invested $95 million in a
brand-new community in Denver called Lyra, adding 215 homes in the tech center submarket. And through the end of October, we've
purchased around $29 million of our common stock. Lyra is a community we've tracked since predevelopment, and we ended up with the
opportunity to get a community that just opened in April and experienced a strong lease-up at a price we believe is below replacement
cost.
Similarly, the shares we purchased in late September and October were made at historically wide NAV discounts and low multiples. The
market is in turmoil, and we don't believe the fundamentals embedded in the business are reflected in the current price of our shares. We
feel great about both investments, which were executed through the lens of how do we improve the portfolio, earnings quality and per
share results.
Going forward, we expect to be in an opportunistic environment, and we'll continue to be aggressive while carefully minding our liquidity
position. None of these results would be possible without a strong team, and I want to thank everyone at Centerspace for their hard work.
And with that, Anne, would you please provide a quick operations update.
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Revenues continue to drive growth with third quarter revenues increasing 11.1% over the same
period in 2021. During the third quarter, our same-store new lease rates increased 7.5% on average over the prior leases and same-store
renewals achieved average increases of 8.7%. On a blended basis, this is third quarter rental rate growth of 8.2%.
While we are starting to see seasonality in leasing velocity, our Mountain West same-store portfolios remain strong with double-digit
new lease rates in Denver, Billings and Rapid City during the quarter. Our non-same-store portfolio achieved increases of 7.7% on
average over prior leases with renewals up 9%, while retaining over 60% of our residents. As we move into the fourth quarter and have
lower expirations, occupancy is trending positively.
Our expense guidance for the remainder of 2022 reflects the volatility we are experiencing in areas such as utilities and uninsured losses
as well as our experience year-to-date on labor and materials. Maintaining our communities remains a top priority for us and inflationary
pressures have driven cost of repair and maintenance significantly this year. We particularly see the impacts in plumbing, flooring and
painting.
Internally, salary and benefits costs have increased year-to-date 6.7% over the prior year, which is in line with CPI increases for wages
and salaries through June. Expense trends vary widely by markets, but across the board, we need to advance efficiencies and contain
expense growth as we head into 2023. It remains a great year for us.
Year-to-date net operating income has increased 10.3% over 2021 as we manage to optimize revenue during the last 18 months of
historic rent increases. We're up to the challenge of providing great homes during times of expense pressure. Now I'll turn it over to Brad
to discuss our overall financial results.
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Thanks, Anne, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported core FFO for the quarter ending September 30, 2022, of $1.15 per
diluted share, an increase of $0.17 or 17.5% from the same period last year. The growth in earnings was fueled by another strong quarter
of same-store NOI growth, which increased by 11.4% versus the same period last year. G&A and property management expenses for the
quarter were $4.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for a combined total of $7.1 million. That included $234,000 related to software
implementation, which was excluded from core FFO as the implementation is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Excluding
the implementation costs on a combined basis, G&A and property management expenses increased by $1 million or 16%, which was
mainly a result of seeing our support functions to service a larger portfolio, mainly due to our significant acquisition of the KMS portfolio.
The KMS acquisition and other acquisitions since the third quarter of last year have increased our revenues by approximately 25% on an
annualized basis.
At the end of the third quarter, we acquired Lyra apartments for $95 million. We funded the acquisition by drawing down on our line of
credit, increasing the balance of the line to $171.5 million at the end of the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average
maturity of our debt was 6.3 years and weighted average interest rate was 3.45%. As of October 31, we had repurchased a total of
427,000 shares or approximately 2.3% of our diluted shares at an average price of $67.25 per share for net consideration of
approximately $29 million.
Turning to guidance, which is presented on Page S 17 of the supplemental. We are updating our guidance for both same-store NOI
growth and core FFO per share, mainly driven by continued expense pressures across the portfolio. Despite increasing our same-store
revenue growth guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint, our same-store NOI guidance is now lower by 75 basis points, driving a
$0.03 reduction in the midpoint of our core FFO guidance.
We saw similar expense increases in our nonsame-store portfolio, which was a larger contributor to the reduction of our core FFO
guidance. A large portion of the increase, however, was driven by larger-than-projected unreimbursable losses of $450,000 in turn
costs, which were significantly higher as some of these units turned for the first time under our ownership.
The acquisition of Lyra contributed another $0.02 worth of reduction to the midpoint of our core FFO guidance. Offsetting these
reductions were lower than projected G&A expenses driven by reduced incentive-based compensation and lower interest expense. In
summation, the changes are discussed resulted in a reduction of $0.07 to the midpoint of our core FFO guidance to $4.46 per share.
As I complete my first year at Centerspace, I'm continually impressed with the commitment to constant improvement across the
organization. I'm confident in our team's ability to navigate the challenges of the coming months and look forward to the years ahead.
And with that, I will turn it over to the operator to open it up for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Thank you. Our first question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
On the Lyra acquisition, what is the expected stabilized cap rate there I think you mentioned that you think it's a discount to replacement
value. So any sort of quantification you can give there? And then when is it expected to stabilize?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes. So we bought that at a going in plus or minus 4.25% on our underwriting, which has some pretty conservative rent growth rates and
it is stabilized. So it's over 90% occupied.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
OOkay. I guess why is there the $0.02 of dilution there in the fourth quarter if it's stabilized already?
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Brad, this is Bhairav. So with respect to the $0.02, that's driven by the rate of interest on the line of credit, which we drew down to fund
the acquisition. So that rate of interest is higher than the stabilized cap rate that Mark mentioned, that's what's driving the dilution.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And so do you have an expectation that there's going to be really strong rent growth with that particular property as kind of the
lease-up leases roll off? Or I guess, how does that transition from being dilutive to accretive.
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes. We do believe it will have strong growth. Again, we didn't underwrite particularly strong growth, but that is what we're seeing in
Denver broadly. And we do believe this asset is well positioned in the submarket. So when we look at it on a more than 90-day basis and
we think about driving margin, portfolio quality, long-term earnings growth, we're quite confident this asset will run faster than many of
our other assets, and we may sell some of those assets to fund this over time. But we also think we bought it at less than it would cost to
build it. So I am mindful -- I think your question is spot on, we take earnings as a consideration, but long-term earnings growth is also a
consideration.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then you mentioned in the release, the noncontrollable unreimbursable expenses. I guess can you walk through exactly
what that is? And is there any quantification you can give as to how much that that's affecting overall expense growth?
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. This is Bhairav. So the nonreimbursable losses, the reference to that was particularly in regard to the non-same-store portfolio
where we've seen more incidents in the third quarter as well as at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Overall, I think just the impact of
those incidents would be about $400,000 or a couple of pennies that would impact the core FFO guidance as you kind of think about it
on a whole year basis.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
 
Unidentified Analyst
Robin Amlan here with BMO Capital Markets. Just wanted to grasp your building blocks to 23. What's the current loss to lease and
earn-in. And could you perhaps walk me through how you calculate in?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes, go ahead. Could you say the last part of the question again, so what's earn-in? And what was the last part of the question?
 
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. It appears to do it differently, just wanted to ask if you can welcome through how you calculate it, you get to earn in?
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. I mean I can take that part first. I mean, overall, if you look at the loss to lease, and we're modeling all our leases as they kind of
come up for expiration. So depending on whether it's being renewed or we're kind of rolling into a new lease, we would just assign the
market rent at that point, depending on whether we believe that's being renewed or it's a new lease. We roughly use about a 50%
renewal rate, and that's how we kind of run that through the model.
And with respect to the loss to lease, I mean, as of September, it was at about 6.5% to 7%. We've captured a lot of that loss to lease as
we kind of went through the summer months. But the market rent kind of keeps changing. So as we kind of try to project out 2023, we
run a curve based on seasonality and that would be expected to increase as we kind of enter the summer months.
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
And this is Anne. Given that we do have a pretty significant nonsame-store portfolio, if we look at the whole portfolio, the last lease is
closer to 8%, that 6.5% to 7% is on samestore only.
 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Looking at repairs and maintenance, what were some of the major drivers for the increased cost? Did perhaps turnover have an
impact?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Anne, do you want to take that?
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes, sure. Thanks. Yes. Turnover was one of the main drivers of our overall expense increase. R&M, separate than turnover is also a big
driver. What we're seeing there is really increased costs related to skilled trades and specialized services like pool servicing, HVAC,
plumbing, we operate in very tight labor markets, and this is a lot of demand.
We have over 40% of our leases turning. And so when we look to our vendors, it's a lot of work for them, and they're having trouble
finding staff and costs are increasing really pretty significantly. On the repairs and maintenance side, another driver that we're seeing is
security costs. Particularly in our urban assets, we've increased security as a way to enhance the resident experience and really make sure
that we can keep our lease rates rising and retain our residents. So we are seeing some increased costs on the security side in repairs and
maintenance.
 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And just given the higher turnover there. Was there anything that's do that as far as moveouts -- move-out reasons?
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes. The largest reason that we see for move outs is relocation. That's really outpaced buying a home, particularly in the third quarter.
There are -- we did have a pretty significant amount of move-outs, a little bit over 5% of our move-outs were eviction related. If you recall,
particularly in Minnesota, we have now -- this year was the year the diction moratorium came off and also all rental assistance has now
dwindled and tapered off. And so we have seen a pretty significant amount of evection-related move-outs. Those typically do drive
turnover costs as well because those units are usually not in very good condition. We have a lot of damage write-offs related to those --
and also, we saw a pretty big spike in legal fees connected to those evections, in the third quarter, in particular.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney Montgomery.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Anne, can you talk about your ability to contain utility costs as the weather gets colder, how successful have you guys been in
sub-metering, RUBS, et cetera? And what your -- have you guys hedged on gas prices and stuff like that?
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes. I can. And then maybe Bhairav can talk a little bit about how we're looking at utility costs and potential to hedge. We have RUBS
across our portfolio. However, that is water, sewer gas and common area electric. We had not included in RUBS heat costs, gas costs
historically. However, that is being rolled out across the portfolio now. So there's always a trade-off there. We operate in a lot of markets
where it's not common to have RUBS at all, much less not include heat and the rent.
So we are rolling that out right now and new leases starting in November. We'll see the renewal leases come on. So as we work through
2023, we think that there's going to be a much less impact on increased utility costs and also an enhancement to our other revenue as
we offset those. But for this year, that takes time as we go through the lease roll and given that we ramp that up this year and are
starting it now, we really won't see those full impacts until 2024 but are planning on doing everything we can to bring those down into
2023. Bhairav, do you want to comment on the hedge?
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. I mean I think as we kind of think about controlling utilities costs, I mean the most effective strategy is what Anne laid out in terms of
being able to pass some of these along. In certain markets, we are not able to hedge it just based on the regulations in place in those
markets. But mostly as we kind of think about utilities offsetting it with. Passing it down would be the most effective strategy plus
hedging in this environment with volatility being where it is, even if we were able to hedge the cost of doing so would be extremely high
in this environment. So it's something that we can evaluate, but it's unlikely that it's something that we will be able to implement in the
near future.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. And then are you guys seeing any -- absent the eviction stuff, which probably been on your radar screen for a while, but are you
seeing any uptick in normal delinquencies and bad debts throughout the portfolio or in certain markets?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Generally, no. I mean, Anne, do you want to give some detail on that?
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes. I would say generally no. In fact, I think we're fairly pleased with the way that our delinquency has come down post-COVID and really
feel like we're returning to kind of pre-COVID levels. Our incomes continue to be very high on our new applications across the portfolio.
And so those rent-to-income numbers are good. We feel really good about the credit quality of our tenants.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. And then last one for me. Any changes on returns or volume of redevelopment that you're planning on doing here given some of
the cost pressures that you talked about on the repairs and maintenance side? I assume that's flowing through redevelopment as well.
Are you getting the returns that you need to get there or want to get there? Or is it situation where you put a pause on that? How are you
guys thinking about the redevelopment process?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Anne, do you want to take that one?
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes. I can't. I think our thought on redevelopment is we want to remain nimble. So we are constantly looking at as costs rise, as
unforeseen circumstances happened during those projects, what the rental rates are, how it's impacting vacancy, how long it's taking to
renew those units. And our goal is to be able to kind of turn it on and off as the market will bear it. So I do think that going into next year,
we're going to really have heightened scrutiny on whether or not we can continue to get the premium.
We feel very good about the projects we've undertaken year-to-date and what has been completed this year. In fact, during 2022, we did
kind of accelerate a couple of our projects and with nonrenewals and really took back a lot of units, which had about a 60 basis point
impact on our overall occupancy in the third quarter.
So right now, we feel really good about it. But with the cost of capital where it is and also the potential for some moderation of overall
market rent growth. I think we're going to have to be very careful headed into next year. We have very good plans and great underwriting
that we feel good about that, that underwriting can change quickly, and we want to be able to change with it.
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Rob, I'd just add on top of that. If you think about work from home and folks can't buy a house, that maybe they are planning and rents
going up everywhere, so a perception of value -- the value add tends to still work. But it is something we're looking at carefully across the
board, as Anne outlined.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell from Piper Sandler.
 
Connor Mitchell
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst
I have 2 questions. The first one relates to the repairs and maintenance. You guys mentioned that it's a pretty tight labor market. So are
there any additional steps you could take maybe bring in outside teams other than -- or outside of your markets to maybe help with the
labor pressure and help fight the cost a little bit? Or any other steps you could take to lower your repair and maintenance cost?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes, I'll start and, Anne, maybe you can check on. But I'd say generally, some -- in particular, in the Mountain West, you just have more,
I'd call them islands for labor. So if you think about, let's say, Dallas versus Denver, I mean, one, Dallas has 10 million people in it. And
two, if you draw a circle of a 4-hour drive around Dallas, you're into several other large metros. If you do that same thing in Denver, you
can't find another similar size city and that would get worse if you went to, say, Rapid City or billings, which are our other 2 Mountain
West markets.
So I think the difficulty in labor there is -- I mean those are super tight markets on an absolute and relative basis, and it's exacerbated by
some of those kinds of factors. But -- so I'd just ask you to consider that. But with that, Anne, why don't you elaborate, please?
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes. We actually have used labor from other markets to travel into markets where we're having difficulty. Particularly on the value-add
side, we might use a contractor from one of our -- team from one of our larger markets and send them to a smaller market. simply given
the cost pressure that that's less expensive to do than higher end market. So that is something that we look at. It is a way that we have
been able to either get large projects accomplished, which otherwise may not have gone forward and/or reduce costs across that.
But our vendors and contractors are having the same issue with labor that I think everyone is, which is very hard to find skilled workers.
And a lot of the R&M costs are related to things like we talked about plumbing, pool maintenance, HVAC. So specialized services, there's
a really high demand on those, and we've seen costs in those areas really skyrocket.
 
Connor Mitchell
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. I appreciate the color. And then my second question is on the current use of capital. And I know you guys mentioned that some
acquisitions now may be tougher potential with the rising rates. So should we expect any further acquisitions or maybe turn to additional
stock buybacks or other uses of capital?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes. So I guess a couple of thoughts on that, Connor. First, we're clearly headed -- I mean, price discovery is a very real and evolving
thing, and that's driven by really -- a pretty significant lack of volume. And if you think about how assets are sold in the apartment space,
I mean, a lot of them are kind of flow oriented. So funds have time lines, what have you.
Most of that flow oriented business is gone, and it's really about situational deals where there's some sort of circumstance or situation
that would cause someone to sell right now because while there's a lot of capital on the sideline, it's all kind of waiting and seeing. So I
think what that means is there will be some interesting situations where someone's inclined to do this, inclined to go to market.
And those might be good opportunities to take advantage, but there's not going to be, I don't think, a lot of volume, at least not in the
next little while. What is coming out for sale, I mean, we're seeing what we think are pretty good prices. Now if you went into like
Rumpelstiltskin mode and just fell asleep in 2017, and I told you those prices, they would feel great. They would probably feel high. But
relative to where we've been in the last few years, they're off quite a bit, 75 to 100 basis points probably.
So I don't think it's the case that multifamily is going to start trading at 7 caps because long-term capital is currently trading or fetching
6s because there's just too much capital out there, and this is a relatively good asset when you're considering alternatives. And if you are
a believer in inflation, which I am and I think our numbers would evidence that it's real.
So to answer your question, we're going to be as opportunistic as we possibly can be, and we're going to really mined our balance sheet,
which was in great shape coming into this, and we hope to exit in great shape as well.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Do you have any plans for dispositions to lock in this arbitrage? I know you said the market is not quite as robust as it is now with the
public equity versus private is probably still a pretty wide gap? And then the second part of the question is with that mindset that
inflation is high and is likely to remain higher. Are you going to look to permanently finance -- term out that line of credit?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
The simple answer to the question is yes to both. But to elaborate a little bit, yes, I mean, we're looking -- we look every quarter at our
assets, and we really try to discern what we think long-term capital expenditures are going to be and kind of look at it after-everything
cash flow.
And it is often the case that a newer asset like Lyra might look quite attractive, and that was just completed in April versus some of our
older properties, which might have a much higher stated cap rate but a much lower kind of after everything cap rate cash flow. And it's
also the case that some of those assets might trade at cap rates that are pretty high and can get neutral or positive leverage.
So when we consider some of our older assets, it might be the case that, that works well for us. So yes, we're evaluating that. We'll
continue to evaluate that. And I would also expect us to put on some longer-term financing for Lyra. And candidly, it won't be as exciting
as I thought it would be because when we agreed to price on that asset, we were looking at 10- to 12-year money in the high 4s , call it,
4.75% range. And today, that money from the agencies is probably mid-5s plus, mid-5% to 6% and it changes every day because
treasury is moving around.
And the unsecured market, which would be our favorite market is kind of priced out of -- priced in a way that would discourage you from
going. So I think for us, unsecured capital today would be mid-6s. And that's -- if you look at the rated -- investment-grade rated
multifamily bonds, they're in the mid-6s the SFRs or low to mid-6s if you look at kind of UDR to DSFRs. And we would be off of those. So
all of that would probably drive us to the secured market. And I would expect to see us pick some debt there.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Yes. I think this moved kind a lot of the soft guard. I just go back to the noncontrollable unrebursable expenses this quarter, do you
have typically every year, I guess, what's the delta that is truly abnormal when we look at the model next year, you should probably look
to take out some of that $400,000. And then on the other revenue, once again, it's a little bit outsized this quarter. Can you elaborate
what's going on there? And what should we not pull forward to the next year's model?
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Sure. I'll take that. On the unreimbursable losses, again, as I said, those were on the non-samestore portfolio, the $400,000 number that
I quoted. And that truly seems to be over than what we had expected. So truly unexpected unreimbursable losses driven by incidents in
that non-samestore portfolio. Coming back to your question on revenue this quarter, in addition to the scheduled rent growth, we've seen
growth across all the categories.
Collections are much better and alluded to a much more normalized collections rate that we have hit upon in the third quarter and
overall year-to-date. So that contributed a bit to the revenue increase year-over-year. Last year in the same quarter, we actually had
lower collections. So that's driving the year-over-year increase. And concessions have been lower. That's also driven some of the
year-over-year increase, and then other revenue is higher. Some of it's driven by RUBS, some of it's driven by some door fees and revenue
sharing agreements that we've signed. And we've had higher application fees and administrative fees and all those things that are
driving other revenue as well in the third quarter.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
 
Buck Horne
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - SVP of Equity Research
I guess, Mark, I'm still struck on the acquisition timing a little bit. And I guess my question is really kind of why now on Lyra and kind of
also why now on stock repurchases when there's a lot of signs out there that rent growth is decelerating pretty rapidly at a market level,
maybe more than just normal seasonality this year, got a lot of recessionary type indicators flashing warning lights out there. As you said,
there's just a huge amount of kind of price discovery that's still evolving right now. What gave you the confidence to kind of go ahead and
go forward with Lyra and also to kind of lever up to do stock repurchases? Yes, I'm just kind of wondering why now? And was there
something specific to the deal?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Good question. I guess the truth of it is, we'll know the bottom in hindsight, and we certainly were trying to call the bottom, but it is our
goal to be an active participant kind of throughout the cycle. And -- this was the submarket we really liked in Denver and asset quality
that we feel confident in. We know this group who built this well and look to financing it on the front end. So we like the asset and felt
like we understood it very well and felt like we understood that there wouldn't be a lot of surprises. Who knows the risk when you buy
something is you learn after you close, but so far, so good on that score.
And we were quite confident that pricing had really moved from kind of earlier in the year. Now it may continue to move. I don't actually
know. I mean there's a whole lot of equity out there kind of in wait-and-see mode. And my guess is they'll -- if you have lots of negative
leverage, you'll use less leverage, and there's lots of buyers out there that can do that.
So why now was, we liked the asset, we liked the submarket. We felt great about it. Candidly, we would have locked the pricing of our
debt better, and it wouldn't have been dilutive as it currently is. But we're not really playing a 90-day game. We're playing a multiyear
game. And on that basis, this made a lot of sense. I'd say similar on the stock. I mean, we have a view of what our NAV is. We update that
quarterly. We talk about it nearly daily. And we have confidence in the business and believe that over the long term, these assets are
worth more than we're currently paying for them. So -- sort of why now.

Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Kind of on -- as the portfolio stands today and with some newer assets, how do you think about the
recurring CapEx run rate of the portfolio now? It looks like samestore CapEx was still elevated even with R&M and turn costs also going
up. Is there a higher level of CapEx to expect out of the portfolio? Or did the newer assets kind of bring down that run rate?
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes and no. I mean as you know, we added that older portfolio, the KMS portfolio, which has been -- has worked very well relative to how
we expected from a cash flow perspective. Those are very old assets that have real CapEx needs and they'll be in the same store next
year. So when you think about what we've talked about over time, in particular with respect to NOI margin, with shrinking that CapEx and
lowering the age of portfolio, I mean, just mathematically, the reality is KMS is a bit of a step back there.
Now our other goals are distributable cash and efficiency of the enterprise from a G&A and property management perspective. So we're
serving a lot of masters there. But I think -- and Bhairav can probably comment in detail. But the CapEx affiliated with KMS coming into
the same-store pool will certainly overwhelm.
I mean the other assets we bought, the [Mint 3] assets, NoCo and obviously, Lyra are all built in the last 5 years. So they should have
relatively low CapEx in the near term. But the KMS that's 2,700 units, so our homes.
 
Bhairav Patel
Centerspace - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. And plus, we budgeted some acquisition capital in the KMS portfolio. So as you look at same-store year-over-year as we enter into
next year with KMS in the portfolio, some of it will be covered as part of acquisition capital. So the run rate shouldn't go up materially as
we kind of start spending some of those acquisition capital.
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Yes. And that number was $40 million, which we've gotten less of it out this year than we planned because it's been hard to get work
scheduled.

Thanks, Buck -- we now have a follow-up question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
I was just curious, Anne, if you had any leasing stats and occupancy numbers that you could give for October.
 
Anne M. Olson
Centerspace - Executive VP, COO, General Counsel & Secretary
Yes, not quite yet. I mean we did see -- I will say what I'm seeing so far as we close out October and get the final documentation into the
system is still really strong renewals. We did -- we have seen a seasonal drop-off in traffic. We were down from August to September,
close to 20% in traffic, again in October, down about 15% in traffic. That is absolutely completely normal for us. And what we're seeing is
just routine seasonality there.
So what we're expecting, given some of the preliminary October numbers is that the new lease rates are going to come down, they
always do in the fourth quarter and that the renewals will remain strong for the first couple of months.
 
Operator
We currently have no further questions. I'll now hand you back over to Mark Decker for closing remarks.
 
Mark O. Decker
Centerspace - President, CEO, CIO & Trustee
Super. Thanks. Well, we appreciate everyone's continued interest in the company, and I'll be at NAREIT in San Francisco in a few weeks
and hope to see some of you there. So thanks very much, everyone, and have a good week.
