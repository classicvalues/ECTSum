Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our 2022 third quarter conference call. On the call with me today is Dave
Dupuy, our Chief Financial Officer; Leigh Stach, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Tim Meyer, our EVP, Asset Management.
As is our normal process, our earnings announcement and supplemental data report were released last night and filed with an 8-K, and
our quarterly report on Form 10-Q was also filed last night. In addition, an updated investor presentation was posted to our website last
night.
The third quarter was busy from both an operations standpoint and from an acquisition standpoint. Our occupancy has risen to 90.8%,
and we have seen a continued pickup in leasing activity. We continue to be encouraged by the activity we see on the part of health care
providers.
Our weighted average remaining lease term remains about the same at slightly less than 8 years. Our asset managers have been very
busy controlling expenses while maintaining tenant satisfaction. As I have indicated for the last several quarters, we continue to have 5
different properties or significant portions of them that are undergoing redevelopment or significant renovations with long-term tenants
in place when the renovations and redevelopments are done.
During the third quarter, we acquired 2 properties with a total of approximately 114,200 square feet for a purchase price of approximately
$17.5 million. The properties are 100% leased, with leases running through 2037 and anticipated annual returns of approximately 9% to
9.72%.
The company currently has 20 properties under definitive purchase agreements for an aggregate expected purchase price of
approximately $71.6 million and expected returns of approximately 9% to 10.17%. The company is currently performing due diligence on
these properties and expects to close these properties in the fourth quarter of this year.
The company continues to have signed purchase and sale agreements for 5 properties to be acquired after completion and occupancy for
an aggregate expected investment of $117.5 million. The expected return on these investments should range up to 10.25%. We expect to
close on these properties throughout 2023 and possibly into 2024. We continue to have many properties under review and have term
sheets out on several properties with anticipated returns of 9% to 10%.
We anticipate having enough availability on our credit facilities and through our banking relationships to fund our acquisitions, and we
expect to opportunistically utilize the ATM to strategically access the equity markets.
On another front, we declared our dividend for the third quarter and raised it to $0.445 per common share. This equates to an
annualized dividend of $1.78 per share, and I continue to be proud to say we have raised our dividend every quarter since our IPO.
I believe that takes care of the items I wanted to cover, so I'll hand things off to Dave to cover the numbers.
 
David H. Dupuy
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Executive VP, CFO & Secretary
Great. Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everybody.
I'm pleased to report that total revenue grew from $23.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 to $24.8 million in the third quarter of 2022,
representing 6.7% growth over the same period last year. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $24 million representing 3.2%
growth quarter-over-quarter. On a pro forma basis, if the 2022 third quarter acquisition had occurred on the first day of the third quarter,
total revenue would have increased by an additional $308,000 to a pro forma total of $25.1 million in the third quarter.
From an expense perspective, property operating expenses grew from $4.1 million in the second quarter to $4.3 million in the third
quarter or 6.5%. The increase was due in part to seasonal increases in utilities expense caused by the hot summer months, along with
increased property tax assessments on some of our properties.
G&A increased from $3.6 million in the second quarter to $3.8 million in the third quarter or 4.2%. Increases in G&A were driven by
increases in noncash amortization of stock-based compensation. Meanwhile, cash G&A expense decreased from approximately $1.4
million in the second quarter to $1.3 million in the third quarter.
Interest expense increased from $2.8 million in the second quarter to $3 million in the third quarter or 9.9%. This increase was due to
increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions as well as an increase in floating interest rates.
Funds from operations, or FFO, for the third quarter of 2022 was flat quarter-over-quarter at $13.8 million. Likewise, on a per share basis,
FFO remained flat at $0.57 per diluted share. As discussed, FFO was impacted by the increase in noncash amortization of stock-based
compensation experienced quarter-over-quarter.
I am pleased to report that adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, which adjusts for straight-line rent and noncash amortization of
stock-based compensation, totaled $15.4 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $14.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 or
7.2% growth year-over-year. On a per share basis, AFFO increased from $0.59 per diluted share in the third quarter of '21 to $0.63 per
diluted share in the third quarter of '22 or 6.8%.
Finally, AFFO grew quarter-over-quarter from $15 million in the second quarter to $15.4 million, representing a 2.5% increase. And on a
per share basis, AFFO increased from $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter of '22 to $0.63 per diluted share in the third quarter.
And on a pro forma basis, if the third quarter acquisitions had occurred on the first day of the third quarter, AFFO would have increased
by approximately $304,000 to a pro forma total of $15.7 million or $0.64 per diluted share.
That's all I have from a numbers perspective. Jason, we're ready to start the Q&A session.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Connor Mitchell from Piper Sandler.
 
Connor Mitchell
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst
I have two questions. So first, you guys have a good relationship with developers building out specialty spaces. So has the weakening
macro had any impact on the propensity for these types of deals?
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
Good morning, Connor, no, we have not seen any effect yet from the weakening macro. I mean, as you can tell by our acquisition pipeline
and our activity in the leasing side, everything is looking very good right now, and we're excited about what we're seeing out in the
environment.
 
Connor Mitchell
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. Great. And then my second question, regarding the acquisition pipeline, touched on it briefly in your opening remarks, but can you
just provide a little bit more color on how you guys are thinking about funding of the pipeline and expected acquisitions to reduce the
ATM debt or the line of credit?
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
Yes. We are anticipating and this isn't a change from what we've said over the last few quarters. We've historically maintained our
leverage level at extremely low levels. We anticipate taking that up a little bit probably into the mid-30% debt to book half and then
looking to utilize the ATM to pull it down. We have -- our banks have indicated a very willingness to fund our acquisitions and are excited
to do that. So we're looking to utilize the bank lines and then utilize the ATM to reduce the bank lines, kind of our normal stuff.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Tim, which assets drove the 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter occupancy pick up to just under 91%. And how much additional
occupancy pickup are you expecting over the next few quarters in the portfolio?
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
I think that's pretty much across the portfolio. I'm looking at Tim Meyer now. Was there anything special, any special type of assets. I
mean, mostly it's MOBs.
 
Timothy L. Meyer
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - EVP of Asset Management
Yes, mostly MOBs, but really it was across our entire portfolio and use type, and we're continuing to see a strong pipeline going forward.
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
So I mean, I would anticipate seeing that increase still. So...
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
All right. And then are you seeing -- how much upward pressure are you seeing on cap rates and sellers willing to adjust at this point to
current market conditions? Or is there still a substantial lag for that for you guys?
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
No, I think we've seen -- it was almost like a switch sometime after the first or maybe the second 75 basis point increase, it was like a flip
of switch, switch is flipped. And it went back to normal type of stuff. I mean, what we've determined is that things have gotten kind of
crazy in the first quarter, second quarter, that we couldn't find our types of properties. But it's just that people who had our types of
properties, all of a sudden back in the first and second quarter, thought they really had 6 caps, and nobody was buying them at 6 caps,
and then once they figured that out and as that environment had gone away, then they were a lot more interested in selling.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then last one for me. Dave, the utilities cost because of the hot summer and the property taxes, is this just a
timing issue before you get reimbursed? Or is this stuff that you're not going to get reimbursed for?
 
David H. Dupuy
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Executive VP, CFO & Secretary
Most of that issue, we have various lease agreements. And so we don't get 100% of those increases, but most of those get reimbursed. I'd
say, 80% plus. So most of that is just a timing difference.
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Wendy Ma from Evercore.
 
BingYi Ma
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Research Analyst
So I just have one question about these 5 properties under the purchase and sale agreements that about the timing. So I think in last
quarter's conference call, you mentioned the timing -- expected timing will be 1 in 4Q '22 and the other 4 throughout 2023. And now it's
more like throughout 2023 and maybe into early 2024. So is there any like reason there could be a delay of this completion and
occupancy for this by properties or -- and should we assume for the time it will be more leaning forward to the second half of 2023
instead of like more evenly spread of the 4 quarters.
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
Good morning, Wendy. And I've almost got to where I've stopped trying to estimate when construction jobs would be complete. And it's
basically the supply chain issues. For inpatient hospitals, you need double compressor HVAC units and you need specialty generators
and various items like that and even elevators. For that matter, even doors, some specialty doors have extremely long lead times now
and the manufacturers are not giving true estimated dates as to when they can be delivered. So it's really tough to determine when a
construction project can be done if you can't determine when you're going to be getting the HVAC units for it or the generator for it or the
-- or again, even the specialty doors for it. So I mean that's why it's been pushed back, why we didn't end up closing 1 -- and why we don't
think we'll end up closing 1 in the fourth quarter and why they've been pushed back. And my best estimate is probably somewhat pro rata
1 a quarter for '23 and then 1 that gets pushed into '24 that's a best guess, but it's all depending upon the supply chain.
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Baird.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Tim, I wanted to go back to the acquisitions that you're set to close here in the fourth quarter. The pipeline pre this quarter was about
$20 million or $25 million on average for assets, and this quarter kind of shrinks down to $3 million. So I'm wondering if you've sourced
all those as individual transactions if there are one or multiple portfolios in there. And maybe talk a little bit about credit on something
like that, that you're considering in these smaller-sized assets?
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, good morning, Dave. And basically, these are our types of assets. They are our bread-and-butter assets that we've invested in for
the last 7 or 8 years, however long it is that we've been public. There is one group of multiple properties and there's a couple of them that
have 2 different properties. I think all total, that there's 8 or 9 transactions that make up the 20 properties. So there's not a single large
portfolio. And basically, they are just kind of our bread-and-butter acquisitions, I think all of them are medical office buildings or
physician clinics. But there's nothing that really stands out or makes them unique. Again, they are our basic bread and butter that we've
invested in.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
So just really the market coming back to you. So that's helpful. And then maybe the other one on redevelopment. And I know
redevelopment, something we talked about last quarter, maybe 2 questions on the 5 properties you mentioned with tenants in place.
And maybe you have this somewhere, I didn't see it or hear it. But square feet of this bucket of 5 properties, I guess, would be the first
question. And second is, does that show up in your occupancy stat today? Or is that kind of future occupancy relative to your occupancy
number today?
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
I'm not really sure how we -- I'm looking at Tim, first, do you know the square foot, Tim? I don't think we've disclosed that, but there's
nothing against it. So...
 
Timothy L. Meyer
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - EVP of Asset Management
No, we have not, but it is leased occupancy. So it is included in our occupancy figures.
 
Timothy G. Wallace
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - Chairman, CEO & President
Okay. And how many square feet, would you estimate?
 
Timothy L. Meyer
Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated - EVP of Asset Management
Anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 square feet roughly.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Great. Well, that's helpful. I appreciate it.

the year. I mean seeing some of you out in neighbor. Thanks so much. Bye.
