Good morning. Thank you for attending today's CubeSmart Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Foram, and I will be your
moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)
It is now my pleasure to pass the conference over to our host, Josh Schutzer, Vice President of Finance. Mr. Schutzer, please proceed.
 
Joshua Schutzer
CubeSmart - Director of Financial Analysis
Thank you, Foram. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to CubeSmart's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Participants on today's call
include Chris Marr, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Martin, Chief Financial Officer.
Our prepared remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. In addition to our earnings release, which was issued yesterday evening,
supplemental operating and financial data is available under the Investor Relations section of the company's website at
www.cubesmart.com. The company's remarks will include certain forward-looking statements regarding earnings and strategy that
involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking
statements. The risks and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements are provided in
documents the company furnishes to or files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically, the Form 8-K, we filed this
morning together with our earnings release filed with the Form 8-K and the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form
10-K.
In addition, the company's remarks include reference to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures
can be found in the third quarter financial supplement posted on the company's website at www.cubesmart.com.
I will now turn the call over to Chris.
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Thanks, Josh. Welcome, everyone. Thanks for participating in our third quarter call.
I'd like to start off by thanking and recognizing all of our CubeSmart teammates, who led by example and demonstrated genuine care
and serving our customers during the hurricane. Thankfully, all of our teammates are safe, and we are working diligently to repair the
physical damage that we experienced. I know all stakeholders of CubeSmart are -- CubeSmart proud of our truly world-class customer
service teams, and we're deeply appreciative of all their hard work.
Turning to the quarter and business. I would say it was a very positive quarter across all segments of our company. Our markets are
experiencing the expected gradual return to more normal seasonality. I will say, albeit at a slower pace than we would have expected as
we entered the year. So that's a positive.
While conditions have normalized, the baseline is so much higher and operating metrics and cash flows are a substantial leg up over
pre-pandemic levels. If you look at a few facts comparing same-store in the third quarter of '22 to the pre-pandemic third quarter of
2019, our occupancy is up 130 basis points, our asking rates are up 36%. The percentage of our customers who have been with us for
more than 2 years is up about 640 basis points and the percentage of our stores impacted by new supply has declined by about 15%.
Our customer behavior continues to be quite positive. Our receivables and write-offs in the third quarter have continued to normalize, but
still remain at or below our Q3 2019 levels.
Turning to look at specific major markets. The MSAs in Florida continue to be very strong. Given the timing, the third quarter results did
not see any impact from customers as a result of the hurricane. However, overall demand trends during the quarter were very solid. The
New York MSA benefited from a relatively easier comp comparing to the third quarter of '21 and consumer demand trends remain very
solid. The Washington, D.C. MSA continues the battle with new supply, and it is certainly weighing on results.
Overall, as embedded in our guidance for the balance of the year, as we continue to normalize and the quarter-over-quarter comps
become more challenging, we expect same-store revenues to decelerate across all of our markets in Q4 and throughout 2023.
The highlight of our investment activity during the quarter was a significant shareholder value that we delivered through the sale of the
assets in one of our joint ventures. Acquisition activity was muted during the quarter, and we expect it to remain so for the balance of the
year as buyers and sellers are in a period of price discovery. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, plenty of capacity and low leverage,
and we believe this sets the table nicely for us to take advantage if and when opportunities are presented to create accretive external
growth.
Certainly, economic conditions are unsettled. CubeSmart is lean and agile with a great balance sheet and an experienced management
team who has been cycle-tested. Historically, self-storage has been a relative outperformer during the weak economy, and we are
confident we are well positioned entering 2023.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tim Martin, to go into some more detail about the quarter. Tim?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Thanks, Chris, and thank you to everyone on the call for your continued interest and support. As Chris touched on, results in the third
quarter continue to reflect a very constructive backdrop for strong operating fundamentals, all of that in the context of a slow return to
more normal seasonality. Our results for the quarter were a bit better than our expectations, leading to an improved outlook for
performance through the end of the year. Headline results included same-store revenue growth of 12.2%. Expenses grew 4.3% and NOI
growth was 15.4% for the quarter.
This quarter marks the 6th consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store revenue and same-store NOI growth. Same-store occupancy
levels remain very healthy while continuing to return to more normal seasonal patterns throughout the year averaging 94.4% in the third
quarter and ending the quarter at 93.8%. Same-store expense growth at 4.3% for the quarter was in line with our expectations and
continues to be driven by pressure on real estate taxes, utilities and property insurance, offset by efficiencies and personnel costs and
lower advertising spend.
We reported FFO per share as adjusted of $0.66 for the quarter, representing 18% growth over last year. On the external growth front, no
surprise and not unique to our sector, we've certainly seen a slowdown of transaction activity over the last couple of months given
interest rate volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. That said, our investments team remains very busy underwriting a good number
of opportunities.
We acquired one store in Atlanta during the quarter for $20.7 million, but from a transactional perspective, as Chris mentioned, the most
notable activity for us during the quarter was related to the sale of the assets in one of our joint ventures. Back in March of 2020, we were
looking at a 14 store portfolio that was on the market and determined that it wasn't a great fit for our on-balance sheet investment
strategy given the markets and asset quality. But we did see a good bit of upside that we could capture by bringing those stores onto our
platform.
So as we've done many times, we looked for a creative solution and ended up acquiring the stores along with a partner with Cube being
the minority 10% of the equity in a structure that gave us a promoted interest opportunity.
Roll the calendar forward then to this past summer, our partner agreed that it was a good time to bring the portfolio back to market as
we had repositioned the assets, pushed rents and improved occupancy levels.
Ultimately, we closed on the sale of all 14 assets to an unaffiliated third-party buyer in August. From a return standpoint, for our position
in the transaction, we invested -- back in March of '20, we invested $5.6 million. Ultimately, we received $51.5 million of distributions
during including the sale in August of '22, for a net cash to us of $45.9 million over a 2.5-year period. Of course, those gains don't show
up in our same-store results. They don't show up in our reported FFO numbers. But obviously, it's a transaction that created a
meaningful tangible value for our shareholders and provides additional capacity for us to be opportunistic as we look forward.
On the third-party management front, we added 39 stores in the third quarter and ended the quarter with 663 third-party stores under
management. Our balance sheet position remains strong as we continue to focus on funding our growth in a conservative manner that's
consistent with our BBB/Baa2 credit ratings.
Subsequent to quarter end, actually, just 2 days ago, this Wednesday, we closed on a new expanded revolving credit facility. The size of
the revolver grew to $850 million, the maturity was extended to February of 2027, and the pricing improved from our standpoint, 17.5
basis points based on our current credit ratings and our current leverage levels. The new revolver further improves what was already a
really solid balance sheet position as this pushes the revolver maturity from 24 to 27, leaving only about $30 million of maturities in each
of 2023 and 2024 and then we don't have another maturity until the very end of 2025 when our '25 senior notes are scheduled to
mature.
The revolver recast went smoothly, and we genuinely appreciate the support we received and for the relationships that we have with the
banks in our bank group. Details of our 2022 revised earnings guidance and related assumptions were included in our release last
evening.
Based on continued strong operating fundamentals, we've increased our guidance range for full year FFO per share by $0.02 at the
midpoint. We also provided an improved outlook for our same-store revenue growth for the year with a new bidding point of 12.5%
growth over 2021 levels and an improved same-store NOI range with a new midpoint of 16% growth. We believe we're set up really well
to wrap up a strong 2022 and are really well positioned heading into the uncertainties that 2023 might bring with our high-quality
platform, our high-quality portfolio and our high-quality conservative balance sheet.
So thanks again for joining us on the call this morning at this time, Foram, why don't we open up the call for some questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
Same-store revenue growth in the quarter was strong, but decelerated about 180 basis points from second quarter. That's -- it had more
than what you saw in the deceleration from the first quarter to the second quarter. The guidance for the fourth quarter implies anywhere
between 8% and 9%. So that implies a larger deceleration of the same-store revenue growth. So I'm just trying to better understand kind
of the cadence and magnitude of the deceleration in some of the operating metrics going forward?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes, Michael, good question. I'll take the beginning part of that. Obviously, for 2023, we're not at a point here to delve into details of
expectations, but your math is correct. And so you're going to see that decel embedded in our guidance across all of our markets from
the third quarter to the fourth quarter. It's driven by the fact that while occupancies are down and our expectation, I think as of yesterday,
we were 85 to -- somewhere between 85 and 90 basis points below last year at this time. So occupancy has stayed pretty consistent in
that range. We've talked before, we don't guide the occupancy, but our expectation by the end of the year is somewhere between 100 and
150 basis points below last year. So you're seeing that occupancy come down, which causes some of the deceleration.
And then from a rental rate perspective, net effective rates for new customers year-over-year during the third quarter across all markets,
we were down high single digits. I think the good news is that's about where we were as of this week. So it really hasn't deteriorated
further. But you would expect that as the comps become more difficult, given that last year was the abnormality in terms of limited
seasonality, but deceleration will continue.
I think the pace will not be consistent. I think you'll see some quarters, again, you're looking at growth rates. So some quarters will be a
little bit higher than others. But we're optimistic because we're going to start '23, as you implied, in that high single-digit same-store
revenue growth. So that momentum will continue into the first quarter and I guess, to some degree into the second quarter of next year.
And we're still working through the details on our expectations and what's going to happen with the economy, et cetera. But macro, if
you think about a 20-year average of same-store revenue growth, I think there's a case that can be made that 2023 results when they're
all in, will very possibly be higher than the 20-year average, but certainly decelerating from where we've been this year and last year.
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
I mean just to pile on, Chris, I made a point in my prepared remarks to talk about our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit
same-store revenue growth because I might not get a chance to say a 7. So those levels of growth, double digit for 6 consecutive quarters
are clearly not sustainable. I think the question is a great one, and it's the question probably on everybody else's mind that's on the call is
trying to delve into '23 guidance and try to figure out exactly the pace of that. And I would say that looking back, and Chris touched on in
his opening remarks, I think looking back, the pace of deceleration throughout this year has been a pleasant surprise to us and I think for
the balance of the industry.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
That's really helpful color, guys. And just as a follow-up, we've seen street rates sort of moderate and we've seen street rates moderate,
the revenue growth has recently been driven a lot by ECRI. So I guess like the question here is, can we continue to push ECRI at a similar
intensity that you have been in a more moderating and maybe pressured street rate environment?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. I mean, again, another great question then comes into the inputs as we try to get our minds around 2023 here and do our
bottoms-up budgeting all these things we're thinking about. The consumer, as I mentioned, the health of the consumer today remains
very good and all of our key metrics that we use to evaluate that remain in a very good spot. I think as we look out. Part of the question is
going to be household savings. Obviously, you can listen to the CEOs of the major banks who believe that, that savings is going to be
there at least through the third quarter of next year.
If that's the case, and we continue to see strong employment, and we look backwards at how storage has performed during brief
recessions. I think the industry is pretty well positioned to put up results that on a relative basis will be very good. And that's kind of
where we are at this point. But plenty of data yet to come here for November and December as we continue to refine our expectations for
next year.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Just hopping on the back of Michael's last question, just on the ECRIs. How do you think about street rate growth in ECRIs, the interplay
between those 2. It seems like over the last couple of years, ECRIs have been larger than average given you had some room to catch up
existing customers given the big increase in street rates, but that seems to be waning. So just curious kind of trying to -- a second go here
at the ECRI question. Will ECRIs naturally come down just because you've closed that gap and street rate growth has slowed, and
therefore, that will be part of the normalization looking out 12, 18 months? Or any color you could provide there would be helpful.
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Great question, Juan. Historically, we would think about decoupling the street rate environment from the existing customer rate increase
environment. It is an input. It is not an overweighted input and not certainly the only input. You think about that specific customer in that
specific cube and how long they've been with us, what the occupancy is at the store, the market in that cube size, the pattern of their
behavior as it relates to payment.
You think about the size of the cube they're in and so the absolute dollar amount that they're paying on a monthly basis, and there are
various other factors that go into the algorithms to determine the most appropriate timing and amount of increase for that specific
customer.
Certainly, what adjoining customers may be paying or when a new customer coming in may be asked is an element. But with pricing
strategies, related to potential length of stay, related to the varying types of discounts or incentives we may provide. It's challenging for a
customer to do a pure kind of apples-to-apples comparison. And obviously, as we've talked about ad nauseam customers are not
particularly inclined to move from one storage facility to another. So I think the thesis that as economic conditions potentially tighten, as
household savings are depleted, as we have the potential for perhaps some increased unemployment the current ECRI levels may
naturally start to come down. But I think it is too soon to say that. And I don't think it's magnitude -- as we sit here today, we would not
expect that magnitude to be overly material in any given sequential month.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
And then just as a follow-up, could you just talk about geographic performance. I'd assume you're getting some benefit from Hurricane
Ian in the Southeast, in particular, the middle of the state of Florida. So that would be part one of the second question. And then
secondly, are you seeing any impact in the slowdown in the housing market in some of the hot markets cooling off at all? I think boys use
like a poster child there.
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
So when you think about the hurricane and the timing and the overall occupancies pre-hurricane in our Florida MSAs. We didn't have a
lot of vacancy to begin with. And the timing is such that we are certainly beginning to see customers who are coming in, who had wind
damage. The possessions are still dry and in good shape. But the physical structure of their home or residence is not. So that will
definitely be a seasonal benefit to the latter part of October and into November here, and that's in our expectations.
From a rest of the country in the housing market, the markets that saw significantly above average growth in same-store revenues and
occupancy and in net effective rates like a Phoenix or a Tucson are those that are coming down then in the deceleration part of the curve
much faster than you're slow and steady markets like a Chicago or in New York. So that's kind of the trends that we're seeing at the
moment.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.
 
Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
I wanted to ask you maybe just on the advertising and marketing side of the business as trends have decelerated into next year and get
back to more normalcy, would you expect that Cubes to start ramping up again back to more kind of like kind of pre-COVID levels?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. That one is a challenging question because we're making decisions on a week-to-week basis here based on a return on each
invested dollar and particularly on each incremental dollar when it relates to paid search. I think we look at it -- that the levers are sort of
intertwined. You have -- how we think about net effective rate to the new customer, so that street rate and that discount or offer if one is
made. What channel the customer is coming through, and then we look at that as a lifetime value opportunity and then what's going on
in the -- particularly in the paid search market.
I think as you're seeing softening, as I'm sure you've seen in the headline results with Google and Facebook and others from an
advertising perspective more globally, which created some opportunities to be a little more efficient and to see some lower costs in the
bid market, that's offset by what our peers, both larger and smaller choose to do market by market with their spend.
So as we look out into the fourth quarter and next year, again, I think that will be a little bit more of a volatile number than some of our
other expenses, which are more easily predictable and consistent quarter-to-quarter. We would certainly expect to see some growth next
year in marketing spend, but not necessarily outsized, that's our thesis at the moment. Again, the whole '23 planning process is in
process.
 
Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Okay. And then I wanted to ask you, at least on the data that we get, it looks like the supply -- the pipeline, it looks like it's actually sort of
ticking up a little bit, which I thought was kind of surprising. I was just wondering if you were seeing that in your market, maybe you could
just kind of talk about competitive supply additions that you're looking at coming on over next year?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. We're not seeing that in our top 12 MSAs. I think we're seeing delays. So without a doubt, you're seeing deliveries that we would have
expected at the beginning of the year, the timing continues to get pushed out. I think that's a positive because I think it is allowing for a
better pace, which is creating an opportunity for the stores that do come on to get leased up a bit before the next one comes on instead
of deliveries happening one rate after another. So I think that's been a positive this year. I think that trend will continue next year. But as
we look out, it's slightly down right now in terms of our expectation going from '22 to '23 in our top markets.
In terms of deliveries, we'll have a better sense of what these delays and how many fourth quarters get pushed out into next year,
although I would say about the same, we would expect to get pushed from late '23 into '24. So I think it's still a constructive supply in the
major markets. I think the data that some of the high-quality folks are producing that track supply nationally. I think that may paint a
different picture given that what we're seeing on the ground from our third-party owners is that those markets that may not have seen
new supply in the last cycle, the more secondary markets are starting to get more and more attention.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Chris, on the expense side, I mean, you've certainly done a good job controlling expenses this year. I guess how sustainable are sort of
low expense growth numbers into next year, right? I'm looking at sort of efficiencies that you've done on the personnel side. I mean, how
much more is there that you can do on that end? Just trying to get a better hold of sort of expense trends over the next sort of, let's call it,
I don't know, 6 to 12 months?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Samir, it's Tim. Good question. I think trends in expenses -- our expectation from a high level is that most of those trends are likely to
continue in the next year, sort of providing guidance here. I think our expectation is that you'll continue -- not only for us, but for others,
continue to see pressure on the property tax line, Chris just explained, marketing is going to be opportunistic as we look at that. From a
personnel standpoint, we are still balancing -- we're still balancing the fact that there's pressure on wage.
It continues to be a challenge to staff in certain markets, although not nearly the challenge that it was a year or 18 months ago, but some
of those pressures and on healthcare costs. But a lot of these pressures, we continue to find ways to be efficient with technology, to be
efficient with how we staff the stores to offset that somewhat. And I think we'll be able to continue to do that. But overall, the
lower-hanging fruit on that tree is starting to get pretty well picked. Expect to see continued pressure on utility costs as we think about
our planning for next year. So I would say from a high-level standpoint, more of the same would be what we would expect over the next 6
to 12 months.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
That's great color, Tim. And then I guess, just to shift over to New York. When you look at sort of revenue growth and NOI growth, it's
certainly trending better than we all thought. I think sort of going into the beginning of this year. I guess, Chris, can you elaborate a bit
more on sort of what you're seeing from a demand side? And even maybe extend -- talk a little bit about supply trends you're seeing in
that market and how you think that landscape sort of plays out over the next 12 months?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. So on the demand side, as you can see with the physical occupancy point, I think we're down 10, 20 basis points in the MSA. It has
been at least through a point during the third quarter, our only major market where occupancy was running a bit higher than last year.
The stores that we have opened in New Jersey and Long Island, Westchester and the boroughs, both Cube and third-party managed have
leased up really nicely ahead of plan from an occupancy perspective.
So the consumer demand, in the MSA as a whole and in the more urban areas, specifically continues to be good. We didn't see in the
MSA the same level of rent growth in '20 and '21 as you would have seen in, say, a Tucson or a Phoenix, so you're just not seeing the same
deceleration in that metric at the same rate as you are in some of the South and Southwest markets. From a supply perspective, we
continue to be cautious, and we will caution everyone, particularly on Brooklyn and Queens that there is an impact, and there will be an
impact. But I will say, I am getting more and more confident that we will be able to navigate through this just fine.
I think when you look at the specifics, store by store, market by market, we have 1 new competitor who's going to open in a crowded Long
Island City market directly next to -- directly across the street from us. One of our stores, impact 2 of our other stores. So that one store
may be problematic. It's been underway for years and years. It looks like it's finally going to get built and open. So that will put some
pressure on that particular little pocket.
We have a store that is supposed to open late '23 in Gowanus, Brooklyn that will have an impact on our owned and managed stores in
that market, where it's exactly situated, it's likely to draw customers from a segment of that market that, frankly, for New York have to
travel a bit of a way to get to us. So I think that impact will definitely be there, but the geography may be a bit helpful to us. And then
there's another store in Brooklyn that will impact us at one of our stores. That's pretty adjacent. So that will have an impact. But you're
talking about 6, 7 stores in the entirety of our borough exposure that should have a comp that will present a little bit of a challenge for us
late in '23 and that's against a portfolio in those 3 boroughs of 50-ish stores when you think about -- or more when you think about
owned and managed. So it's going to be there. But I think we're going to be okay again as we navigate through this.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
I wanted to ask about investments a little bit. You've been a little bit more conservative or disciplined, I guess, on the investment front.
Can you just talk a little bit about the pipeline of deals that you're looking at today? What deal flow looks like in general? And in terms of
underwriting investments, whether or not you're changing your IRR hurdles and how you're thinking about underwriting deals today,
whether there's changes in sort of your market rent growth forecast or otherwise?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Todd, it's Tim. Thanks for the question. As you would expect, and as I mentioned in the previous remarks here, the activity has certainly
slowed. It went for -- it went through, I would say, the middle part of the summer where there's quite a bit of price discovery, but -- and
the buyer pool started to shrink a little bit, but you still had a handful of folks seemingly on every deal that we're still pursuing pretty
aggressively. And then as you got later into the summer and into the early fall, started to hear some rumblings about some deals that
we're starting to fall apart and folks walking away or retrading or walking away from deposits.
And again, not unique to our sector. I think that makes a lot of sense when there's the volatility that we've seen broadly in the capital
markets. I think then where you are is absolutely in a period of price discovery where sellers had grown accustomed to what the market
looked like 6 months ago. And buyers are trying to adjust to where they think the market is going to be in 6 months from now. And so I
think you've seen a little bit of a slowing down of opportunities that have come across our desk to underwrite. I think what we have seen
is a continuation throughout 2022, that the opportunities that we have looked at are just not of the same quality that we saw in 2021.
That's been consistent throughout the year.
There are a handful of deals that are super attractive to us based on market and physical quality. But overall, the opportunity that has
been of lower quality this year, which has been a big driver in our appetite and the volume that you've seen from us. I think that touched
on most of your question, but was there anything else that you wanted to talk about?
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Have you changed your return requirements? I mean are you seeing -- can you talk a little bit about price trends, cap rates, I guess, going
in cap rates are not always relevant, obviously, but maybe IRR hurdles and what you're seeing in the market and how you've adjusted
your underwriting?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Yes, sure. The underwriting itself has actually, over the past year or 2 has actually gotten to be a lot more fun. It used to be fairly simple
to underwrite a storage facility. And then several years back when you start to get into the heat of the development cycle that we're now
on the tail end of that created some complexity in the variables that go into underwriting and opportunity. Throw on top of that, the
volatility that we've seen in asking rate growth largely coming through the COVID demand, trying to calibrate your underwriting to think
about where rate growth will continue to go or how it will moderate.
So the process of underwriting a opportunity hasn't changed. The variability and the volatility of the input certainly has, which makes it
more interesting to go through. Certainly, from a return standpoint, we are -- we've adjusted the returns that we're requiring across the
spectrum of early-stage lease-up all the way through stable based on our cost of capital, both equity and debt.
We look for opportunities that are perfect infill, high-quality, complementary to our existing high-quality portfolio. And we have the
luxury and the flexibility of having very low levels of leverage and a lot of availability of capital that we don't necessarily have to look at
the stock price every day for a 1 or 2 or 3 asset portfolio. But we're very disciplined. We'll be patient, and we think that there are likely to
be some great opportunities for us in the coming months and quarters.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Can you share how asking rents trended during the quarter and through October on a year-over-year basis? And then can you talk
about what kind of market rent growth you might think is reasonable to expect in '23? Any sense?

Todd, it's Chris. So as I mentioned earlier, the NER for new customers in the quarter was down high single digits, and that's where we are
across markets as of this week. So fortunately, and I think positively hasn't declined further as we've gotten here into October. But as
we've gone through the year and the comps from last year, which had no seasonality, just get tougher and tougher, that's gone from
down 2%, 3% to 4%, 5% and now we're kind of averaging in that high single digits.
As we look out and try to underwrite, as Tim said, for the future, it's really market specific. So I think it's fair to say over the near term, as
we try to get back into a more normalized trend of seasonality and customer behavior and you look at the comps to last year and into the
first quarter of this year, it will be challenging comps as you think about trying to project out. But that's really -- again, since we're doing
everything at an asset level here, it depends upon where we're seeing the opportunity. What stage of lease-up that asset is in and what
we see unique about that particular market or submarket.

Our next question comes from the line of Lizzy Doykan with Bank of America.
 
Elizabeth Yang Doykan
BofA Securities, Research Division - Research Analyst
I wanted to ask about just the new extension on the revolving credit facility. I believe you said the discussions went well with the banks.
I'm just wondering what you're noticing out there in terms of going out and obtaining financing given how tough the market conditions
are, do you foresee, I guess, how are your discussions with the banks going now? Or what do you kind of see with -- in your relationships
with them?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Lizzy, thanks for the question. Yes, it was a -- in a normal course for us, given the 2024 maturity for the revolver, and I would say,
different more normal, less volatile times, we probably would have waited to recast our facility for probably until the middle part of 2023.
But looking at and always having a view on derisking that side of the business when we feel like it's appropriate to do so. We had -- we
started the process several quarters ahead of when we normally would just in case the market continues to move in a direction where
lenders are a little bit stricter or have a little bit less flexibility or it's just, frankly, not as much of a borrower's market as it has been. And
so we have very strong, very long-standing relationships with a really high-quality bank group. And work hard to have great partnerships
with those institutions.
And I think as a result of that, we had a fairly smooth process at a time where I do believe that obtaining financing is getting and it's
going to get more challenging here in the coming months and coming quarters. So we're happy to have closed it here earlier this week
and again, just derisk and not have to really worry about our maturity schedule here until very late in 2025 and facing down some
uncertain times. We feel like that's a pretty good position for us to be in.
 
Elizabeth Yang Doykan
BofA Securities, Research Division - Research Analyst
That's great color. And then I just wanted to ask about the sales from the [Fund V] JV. How are you thinking about your focus with
regards to capital allocation, particularly with use of your joint venture partnerships I guess, what makes the most sense? Does it kind of
depend on the opportunities. Specifically, I know with this deal, the assets where you said they were not in line with what's been on your
balance sheet. But I just want to kind of get a better understanding of how you gauge opportunities with your partnerships?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Yes, I'd say it starts for us with -- we have had, we believe, a very, very well articulated and consistent strategy as to what we want to have
on our balance sheet. Our desire is to have the highest quality portfolio in the highest quality markets. And so when we find opportunities
to do that, especially on stabilized assets, our preference is to buy those on our own 100% owned simple capital structure, easy for
shareholders and investors to understand.
Once you get past that, then we have found many opportunities for many different reasons to look at co-investment vehicles, ranging
from more recently having ventures that are focused on stores that are in early-stage lease-up because we've had a lot of opportunities
to bring third-party managed stores from our platform onto our balance sheet in some way, but frankly, in early-stage lease-up in a
venture structure, we can bring on 5 in a venture for every one that we could bring on balance sheet and to manage the dilution, ideally
set that up in a way that when those stores stabilize, our partners hold period will have -- lines up pretty well with when they stabilize,
and then ideally, we would then have the opportunity to buy in their position and achieve our original overall objective.
In the case of the one that we just exited, as you touched on, it was unique in that it didn't really fit that category, but we thought we
found an opportunity to bring it on to our platform, add a lot of value, and it worked out fabulously partially due to great timing. But
we've had co-investment structures for a variety of different reasons and would expect to use them going forward for similar reasons.

Our next question comes from the line of David Balaguer with Green Street.
 
David Balaguer
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Associate
I wanted to touch on the New York market again. As you mentioned something about the occupancy being a bit stickier relative to other
markets, but rent growth, at least on a relative basis lagging a little bit compared to some other markets and wanted to touch on that
phenomenon. Is that just a length of stay difference in New York compared to other markets? And what does that difference look like?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. I think broadly, it's just a consumer in many of our stores in all of the boroughs who is in the neighborhood and uses the product on
a, I'll call it, a more regular basis. So it does just tend to be attractive to folks living in very small residences who will use CubeSmart and
visit us frequently as opposed to just an overwhelming customer base at a particular store that is just the typical mover. So I think as a
result, you just get a stickier customer. And again, I think just the phenomenon we saw not just in New York, but across all of our urban
stores, in most markets is that you just didn't see quite the rent growth in '21 as you would have seen again in the more suburban or as I
pointed out, some of the Southwest markets that saw big shifts in the population.
 
David Balaguer
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Associate
Great. And with that occupancy being a bit sticky, would you expect moving forward to the extent we see a lot of the hot markets slow
down, would you think that the positive rent growth trends in New York might be a bit stickier than some of those other markets?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. I think as you see, again, the decline in the deceleration in some markets, on a relative basis wouldn't expect in the urban markets to
see it at the same rate.
 
David Balaguer
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Associate
Got it. And just shifting back in moving rates, can you remind us what that typical sort of peak to trough decline and move-in rates in a
normal year looks like from, say, the peak summer months to slower winter months?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. It's a pretty wide range when you just think about A time and B markets, but call it in that 10% to 20% range.

Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Just one more question on the New York City supply topic. When you look at some of the data providers out there, they're showing about
the 19% figure on supply growth. Obviously, that includes stuff that would never get built, probably plenty of that. And then I try to marry
that versus some of your commentary, you're providing that supply risk, doesn't look that bad. Can you help us bridge that gap? And I
know it's not your job to know what other data providers are saying, but it just seems to be a pretty wide spread between what you're
seeing and what some of the data providers are showing.
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
Yes. Thanks, Ki. One, I think -- and again, this is, again, not -- I believe when you're looking at that data, it is the MSA, not the boroughs
particularly. So you're picking up all of Jersey, Long Island, Westchester as well as Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. So
again, when you look at that supply and its competitive impact, particularly on Cube, many of those stores that are going to open are just
in markets, submarkets where we don't have a presence. So when I'm looking at it, I am specifically looking at what we know is entitled
and either under construction or some sign of movement that tells us it's actually going to get done in the next 18 months or so in
markets where we'll create some competition to Cube.
So when I think about that, and I answered the question relative to Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, there is, as I said, 1 store in Long
Island City, 1 in Gowanus, 1 in East New York and 1 kind of on the very edge of Atlantic Avenue that will have -- assuming they get
completed here at the latter part of '23, will have -- we'll be competitors in one way, shape or form to Cube. Again, given the dynamics of
New York City, they will also be competitors to, I think each of the other public REITs who also own a store management store in that
same general area. As you get into New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, it's a lot -- obviously, it's a much larger area and stores tend to
be not clustered as they are in the boroughs.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Great. And the second question, going back to the topic about expenses and how we should think about that for next year. Texas and
Florida are some of your biggest markets, and we've seen property taxes go up a lot, maybe more for homes than maybe self-storage
product, but I was curious, in your thinking for next year if you're -- what are you expecting for property taxes in markets like that.
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
We're expecting them to go up for sure. I think some of those areas, we're still waiting to finalize and see what the impact is for 2022 as
we're finally getting bills in for some of those. So hard to look at exactly where those are going to be, but those are certainly markets that
are under pressure that have been and are likely to continue to be. And we'll try to provide some color on that next quarter when we
provide '23 guidance.
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
And if you look at real estate tax expense. Yes, if you look at real estate tax expense growth over the last years, the range of growth has
been fairly consistent, and I don't think as you look forward right now, at least our expectation is that's going to change all that month.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
And if I could squeeze a third one here. What other promote opportunities are there in your JVs?
 
Timothy M. Martin
CubeSmart - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Many of our JVs, if not most, have some type of promoting either in our favor or our partners' favor, oftentimes on our development
ventures, our partner actually has a promoting interest. So it's a fairly common -- it's a fairly common component to many of our
ventures, and we can be on either side of it. This one, obviously, that we touched on that we monetized here this quarter was one that we
were on the side of -- we were in a position to be the big value add by bringing it on and doing all the hard work to get the stores prettied
up and professionalized and leased up. And so that was a great opportunity that we were on that side of the equation. But it can be -- it
can go in either direction depending on the opportunity.

Our final question comes from the line of Michael W. Mueller with JPMorgan Chase.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I just have one question. Has there been any change to the percentage of customers that have been in place over a year and over 2 years?
Anything material?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
So great question. And factual answer is for the greater than 1 year, the change has been minimal. So those customers, both greater than
6 months and greater than 1 year, it's been pretty consistent. For those that are greater than 2 years, it has gone up about 5%.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
And that's over what time period?
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
That is comparing this year to -- yes, year-over-year.

Those are all the questions we have registered in the queue. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now pass back to
Chris Marr for closing remarks.
 
Christopher P. Marr
CubeSmart - CEO, President & Trustee
All right. Thanks, everybody, for a very good call. I really appreciate the interest and the questions, enjoyed sharing our thoughts with
you. As I said, we -- the team is in good shape. We have the appetite to find external growth. We have the balance sheet capacity to
execute on that appetite, but we will remain disciplined. We will remain focused on finding opportunities that are accretive to our
portfolio, to our customer base, to our earnings. And so we will be patient. As we try to look out into 2023, certainly, the change in the
debt capital markets and potentially some changes in economic conditions could create some attractive opportunities for us. And if that's
the case, we are ready to take advantage of them. Meanwhile, from an internal growth perspective, I think we're confident that storage
and cube will continue to perform well.
We're confident that our portfolio is well positioned on a relative basis to achieve that performance and the team certainly is focused. So
thank you all for your attention and participating in the call. Look forward to speaking to many of you in person out in the West Coast
here at NAREIT and looking forward to speaking to you again when we report end of year and produce our expectations for 2023. Thanks
again. Take care.
