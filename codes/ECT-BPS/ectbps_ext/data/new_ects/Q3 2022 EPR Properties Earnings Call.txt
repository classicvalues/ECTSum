Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ERP (sic) [EPR] Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today,
Brian Moriarty, VP of Corporate Communications. Brian, you have the floor.
 
Brian Moriarty
EPR Properties - VP of Corporate Communications
Thank you, Stacy, and thanks to everybody for joining us today on the EPR Properties Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast.
Participants on today's call are Greg Silvers, Chairman and CEO; Greg Zimmerman, Executive Vice President and CIO; and Mark
Peterson, Executive Vice President and CFO.
I'll start the call by informing you that this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Act
of 1995, identified by such words as will be, intend, continue, believe, may, expect, hope, anticipate or other comparable terms.
The company's actual financial condition and the results of operations may vary materially from those contemplated by such
forward-looking statements.
Discussion of these factors that could cause results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are contained in the
company's SEC filings, including the company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.
Additionally, this call will contain references to certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful in evaluating the company's
performance.
A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and
supplemental information furnished to the SEC under Form 8-K.
If you wish to follow along, today's earnings release, supplemental and earnings call presentation are all available on the Investor Center
page of the company's website, www.eprkc.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg Silvers.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's third quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast. In the
third quarter, we delivered healthy earnings growth as we continue to see resilience at our customers' businesses amidst sustained
consumer demand for the experiences provided by our customers.
Additionally, we have yet to see any meaningful impact on demand from inflationary pressures. Today, we are also reintroducing rent
coverage disclosures. As Greg will highlight, we believe this data demonstrates the strength of the recovery of our non-theater properties
while providing a baseline for our theater portfolio.
Even as the recovery is still taking shape, our overall rent coverage is above the 2019 pre-pandemic level. Our theater coverage
demonstrates that consumers want to see films in theaters and as studios ramp up their production schedules, we anticipate that
coverage will improve as well.
In 2019, we introduced our strategic focus on properties which support the experience economy. While we could not have foreseen that
our properties would have been tested so severely by a pandemic, we believe the experience economy is alive and well and our investing
thesis remains intact. As is evidenced by the variety of properties we are highlighting today and have discussed throughout 2022, we are
uniquely positioned to gain access to and pursue the broader set of experiential properties within our target set.
Everyone is painfully aware of the current disruption in the capital markets and our job as stewards of capital is to be prudent with its
deployment. As a result, we decided to moderate our growth in the near term in response to our increased cost of capital. This
moderation is not a reflection of fewer opportunities, rather our discipline given current conditions. We will not grow simply to get larger.
Rather, we will demand earnings accretion with our investments.
We continue to generate significant excess cash flow, which combined with our undrawn line of credit, will support a more limited
investment spend without sacrificing our investment-grade credit.
Lastly, it's clear that the Cineworld restructuring and the broader market turbulence have combined to create a significant dislocation of
our stock price. Our current stock price earnings multiple is significantly discounted relative to historical levels, even as we are paying a
well-covered dividend that is supported by our free cash flow. As we pursue a resolution with Cineworld, we remain focused on the
fundamentals of our business. We appreciate the support of our investors who are focused on the fundamentals and we look forward to
delivering strong total shareholder return over the long term. Now I'll turn it over to Greg Zimmerman, who will cover the business in
greater detail.
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Thanks, Greg. At the end of the second quarter, our total investments were approximately $6.6 billion, with 356 properties in service and
97% leased. During the quarter, our investment spending was $82 million. 100% of the spending was in our experiential portfolio and
included the acquisition of a project for redevelopment and additional financing for an existing asset. Our experiential portfolio
comprises 282 properties, with 47 operators and accounts for 91% of our total investments, or approximately $6 billion, and at the end of
the quarter was 97% occupied. Our education portfolio comprises 74 properties with 8 operators, and at the end of the quarter, was
100% occupied.
While broadly, there is increasing macro uncertainty and concern around inflation and the possibility of a recession, we believe our
value-oriented, drive-to destinations will prove to be resilient because they provide a compelling value proposition for families. To date,
we have not seen meaningful impact on our operators from inflation or gas prices and our expectation is that this will be the case in the
event of continuing challenging economic conditions.
As noted last quarter, with the stabilization of our portfolio after COVID, we are reinstituting coverage disclosure. We thought it would be
helpful to compare our most recent coverage data. The most recent data is based on a June trailing 12-month period, except for
attractions, which is August, and ski, which is April, as noted on the slide.
Importantly, overall portfolio coverage exceeded 2019. Overall portfolio coverage for the trailing 12 months is 2x compared to 1.9x for
2019. For theaters, trailing 12-month coverage is 1.3x, with box office at $7.1 billion for the same period. In 2019, theater coverage was
1.7x, with $11.4 billion in box office. For the non-theater portion of our portfolio, trailing 12-month coverage is 2.8x, compared to 2.2x for
2019.
Now I'll update you on the operating status of our tenants. Q3 total box office was $1.9 billion. Total North American box office for the
first 3 quarters was $5.6 billion. Our high-quality theater portfolio continues to outperform the industry. As mentioned on our second
quarter call, at $1.13 billion, July was the highest grossing month since December 2019, led by Minions: The Rise of Gru, Thor: Love and
Thunder, Top Gun: Maverick, Elvis and Nope.
As expected, due to a lack of tent-pole product, August and September results were muted, with no releases generating $100 million. Q4
is anchored by 3 major releases: Black Adam with Dwayne Johnson, which has grossed over $115 million since opening on October 21; the
Marvel Universe film, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, opening November 11; and Avatar: The Way of Water, opening December 16.
The 2023 slate is beginning to take shape. The top 5 announced titles, each of which could exceed $200 million in North American box
office, include Ant-Man and The Wasp, Guardians of the Galaxy 3, The Little Mermaid, Captain Marvel 2 and Aquaman 2.
As this year's results demonstrate, when there are movies to see, consumers of all ages are returning to the theater. They still want to see
good films on the big screen. With studios recognizing the economic benefit of a theatrical run and more films beginning production post
COVID, we are confident supply will improve.
Finally, as previously disclosed, on September 7, 2022, Cineworld filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Texas. While we did not receive September rent or September deferred rent, we did receive our entire October
and November rent payments, along with the October and November deferred rent payments. This week, there have been headlines in
the press suggesting that Cineworld reached a bankruptcy settlement with its landlords and lenders. Without mentioning EPR
specifically, this appears to have created the impression that we and Cineworld's other landlords have resolved any discussions about
leases with Cineworld. While we can't speak for other landlords, we are in the early phase of discussions with Cineworld and have not
reached any agreements of any kind. The settlement referred to by the media was limited to the approval of a modified and improved
$1.9 billion debtor-in-possession or DIP financing, which included several protections sought by Cineworld's landlords.
In addition, Cineworld agreed to pay its landlords a portion of the unpaid post-petition September stub rent over 4 months. This
settlement did not address issues regarding assumption or rejection of leases, future rent or the future management and operation of
properties. Because the bankruptcy process is ongoing, beyond those updates, we will not comment about Cineworld.
Turning now to an update on our other major customer groups. We continue to see good results and ongoing consumer demand across
all segments of our drive-to, value-oriented destinations. Our Eat & Play assets continued their strong post-pandemic performance, with
portfolio revenue up 15% and EBITDARM up 9% over Q3 2021. Through much of our attractions and cultural portfolio, attendance and
EBITDARM were up over Q3 2021. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Canadian parks: Village
Vacances Valcartier and Calypso Waterpark. Construction of the Hotel de Glace (ice hotel) will begin in the coming weeks, with opening
scheduled for January 4.
We continue to see extremely strong occupancy and continued ADR growth at The Springs Resort. Based on reported solid season pass
sales, we are anticipating a good ski season. During the off-season, lift replacements were completed at 5 of our assets.
Revenue growth continued across our experiential lodging portfolio, with continued ADR growth. We are seeing uplift from our
renovations at The Beachcomber and Bellwether Beach Resort in St. Pete Beach. We prepared for the impact of Hurricane Ian at both
properties, but when the path shifted south, we avoided any significant damage.
We celebrated the grand opening of the second phase of our successful Camp Margaritaville RV Resort & Lodge in Pigeon Forge,
Tennessee and are making progress with the planned enhancements at our Jellystone Park Warrens and Cajun Palms RV Resort.
Our education portfolio continues to perform well, with year-over-year increases of 17% in revenue, 28% in EBITDARM and 24% in
enrollment across the portfolio. After the close of the quarter, our early childhood education tenant, Creme de la Creme, which operates
21 of our early childhood education assets, was acquired by KinderCare. We view this as a positive credit enhancement.
Turning to a quick update on capital recycling. During the quarter, we sold 2 vacant theaters and a vacant land parcel for total net
proceeds of $9.9 million and recognized a combined gain of $300,000. We have executed contracts of sale for 2 of our 3 remaining
vacant theaters and expect them to close in 2022 or 2023. We continue discussions with multiple parties on the third theater.
During the quarter, our investment spending was $82 million. We closed on the acquisition of a former conference center in Murrieta,
California, for approximately $43.6 million in a sale leaseback transaction. Murrieta is in Riverside County, midway between Los Angeles
and San Diego. The asset has natural hot springs and was originally developed in 1902 as a hot springs resort and operated for many
years as a wellness center. In partnership with the operator of our very successful Springs Resort in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, EPR will
invest another approximately $50 million over the next 2 years to redevelop the existing buildings into a brand-new hot springs resort.
As discussed on last quarter's call, in Q3, we also closed on an additional approximately $26 million in financing for our premier
4-season Alyeska Resort in Girdwood, Alaska. After the end of the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of additional land in Pagosa
Springs for the expansion of The Springs Resort for approximately $5.6 million. EPR is committed to invest an additional approximately
$58 million over the next 2 years for the expansion. And finally, again, after quarter end, we closed on a commitment with a new partner
to provide up to $68 million in long-term mortgage financing to fund the addition of an indoor water park as part of the expansion of an
existing project. We are excited about the opportunity and we'll share more details after our new partner has publicly announced the
project.
We've made substantial progress on our investment pipeline coming out of the COVID pandemic. Cap rates are around 8% and should
create compelling long-term value. We're pleased with the investment cadence and diversity we will achieve through 2022 and beyond.
We are seeing a lot of high-quality opportunities to fund build-to-suit, redevelopment and expansion projects in many of our experiential
categories. By their nature, redevelopment and expansion projects tend to stretch over several years. And as a result, there is a timing lag
for capital deployment after commitment.
We're updating our investment spending guidance for funds deployed in 2022 to a range of $375 million to $425 million. Through the
end of Q3, we have funded over $321 million for acquisition, refinancings and new development projects in Eat & Play, attractions, ski,
health and wellness and experiential lodging. In addition, with transactions that have closed through October 31 that are not yet funded,
we have committed an additional approximately $250 million for experiential development and redevelopment projects to be deployed
over the next 2 years.
Finally, given our cost of capital and the current inflationary economic environment, we have consciously decided to reduce our
near-term investment spending and to fund those investments primarily from cash from operations, and with our borrowing availability
under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We are being more judicious with future investments and acquisitions to shepherd capital
under -- until economic conditions improve and our cost of capital returns to historical levels. Among the positives of our focus on
development and redevelopment investments as we restarted our investment pipeline in 2022 is increased revenue in 2023 and 2024 as
they fully come online. I now turn it over to Mark for a discussion of the financials.
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thank you, Greg. Today, I will discuss our financial performance for the quarter, provide an update on our strong balance sheet and close
with updated 2022 earnings guidance. FFO as adjusted for the quarter was $1.16 per share versus $0.86 in the prior year, and AFFO for
the quarter was $1.22 per share compared to $0.92 in the prior year.
Now moving to the key variances. Total revenue for the quarter was $161.4 million versus $139.6 million in the prior year. This increase
was due primarily to improved collections from certain tenants, which continue to be recognized in revenue on a cash basis or had
previously received abatements. As to Regal, we received all rent and deferral payments for July and August, but as Greg mentioned, we
did not receive the rent or the deferral payment for September. Also contributing to the increase for the quarter was scheduled rent
increases as well as the effect of acquisitions and developments completed over the past year. This increase was partially offset by the
impact of property dispositions.
During the third quarter, all deferred rent and interest was collected as scheduled, except Regal's September deferral payment that I just
mentioned. We collected $4.5 million of deferred rent from accrual basis tenants and borrowers that reduced receivables, leaving a
balance on our books at September 30 of $7 million. We expect to collect approximately $5 million of this remaining balance in the
fourth quarter.
Additionally, during the quarter, we collected $4.6 million of deferred rent and $0.8 million of deferred interest from cash basis
customers that were recognized as revenue when received and which were not included in our guidance. At September 30, we had
approximately $123 million of deferred rent owed to us not on the books, which will continue to be recognized only as cash is received.
Regal makes up approximately $92 million of this balance and is subject to the bankruptcy negotiation that Greg mentioned. I will
provide more on cash basis deferral collections when I review our updated earnings guidance.
Moving on, we had higher other income and other expense of $3.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively, due to improved performance at
The Kartrite Resort & Indoor Waterpark and 2 theater properties that we operate. Mortgage and other financing income was $9.6 million
for the quarter versus $8.5 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $0.8 million in deferral collections from a cash
basis borrower I mentioned previously. Percentage rent for the quarter totaled $1.5 million versus $3.1 million in the prior year. The
decrease versus prior year related to less percentage rent from an early education tenant based on a restructured lease, which has higher
base rents in 2022. This was partially offset by higher percentage rents recognized from our golf entertainment tenant.
G&A expense increased by $1.4 million versus prior year, primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefit costs, including stock grant
amortization as well as an increase in travel expenses and professional fees.
Lastly, FFO as adjusted from joint ventures increased by $2.1 million versus prior year to $2.7 million. This was due primarily to the
performance of our investment in the Jellystone RV Park in Wisconsin that was purchased in late August of 2021 and our new investment
in the Cajun Palms RV Resort in Louisiana.
Turning to the next slide, I will review some of the company's key credit ratios. As you can see, our coverage ratios continue to be strong,
with fixed charge coverage at 3.2x, and both interest and debt service coverage ratios at 3.8x. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDAre was
5.2x and our net debt to gross assets was 39% on a book basis at September 30. Lastly, our common dividend continues to be very well
covered with an AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter of 68%.
Now let's move to our balance sheet, which is in great shape. At quarter end, we had a consolidated debt of $2.8 billion, all of which is
either fixed-rate debt or debt that has been fixed through interest rate swaps with a blended coupon of approximately 4.3%.
Additionally, our weighted average consolidated debt maturity is 5.5 years, with no scheduled debt maturities until 2024. We had over
$160 million of cash on hand at quarter end and no balance drawn on our $1 billion revolver. We are revising our guidance for 2022 FFO
as adjusted per share to a range of $4.50 to $4.68 from a range of $4.50 to $4.60, reflecting an increase of $0.04 per share at the
midpoint.
As shown on the slide, revised guidance at the midpoint includes full rental payments for Regal leases of approximately $7.1 million per
month for October, November and December. Note that our policy regarding deferral payments from cash basis customers is to include
in guidance only if already received. Accordingly, for Q4, we have included deferral payments of $1.5 million per month received from
Regal for October and November and $0.5 million per month received from non-Regal tenants for October and November.
The lower end of guidance, among other things, reflects the uncertainty of the timing and amount of rent for December from Regal,
given its pending bankruptcy. The upper end of guidance, among other things, reflects the potential to collect additional deferral
payments from Regal and non-Regal customers for December not included in the midpoint, as well as the potential to collect a portion
of Regal's September rent before year-end. With that background, I thought it would be helpful to provide a reconciliation of the increase
in the midpoint of our FFO as adjusted per share guidance of $0.04 to $4.59 from the prior midpoint of $4.55.
As you can see on the slide, the increase is due to including $0.12 of additional deferral collections for Q3 and Q4 from cash basis
customers, all of which has been received to date and is not in prior guidance, plus $0.01 from an increase in expected percentage rents,
primarily from certain attraction properties, offset by $0.09 for Regal's September rent. Note also that the midpoint of our guidance for
the year implies an FFOAA per share for Q4 that is similar to that of Q3. While we do expect an additional month of Regal minimum rent
and higher percentage rents for Q4, this is expected to be offset primarily by seasonal losses at our managed properties and joint
ventures.
Finally, we are reducing our guidance for investment spending to a range of $375 million to $425 million from a range of $500 million to
$700 million. This is due primarily to the mix of deals being more skewed towards development and redevelopment, where we are
finding better risk-adjusted returns versus acquisitions. As a result, we have approximately $250 million of commitments on closed
experiential development and redevelopment projects as of October 31 that we expect to fund over the next couple of years.
Given our strong balance sheet and liquidity as well as our anticipated significant cash flow generation, we do not anticipate the need to
raise additional capital to fund these commitments. Guidance details can be found on Page 24 of our supplemental. Now with that, I'll
turn it back over to Greg for his closing remarks.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Thank you, Mark. As our quarterly performance indicates, the experiential economy continues to perform despite the headwinds of
inflation. Our company rent coverage, driven primarily by our non-theater portfolio, is now above 2019 levels and we continue to be
pleased with the recovery of the exhibition business. Overall, we had a very productive quarter with strong results and quality
investments. As Greg discussed, with approximately $250 million of future commitments, we are again demonstrating the depth of our
investment pipeline yet we remain prudent in our capital deployment given the backdrop of challenging capital markets. Our confidence
is grounded in the resiliency of the experiential sector and our ability to execute on our strategy. With that, why don't I open it up for
questions?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein at BofA.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Kind of wanted to kind of hear a little bit more on, I don't know if there's any more you can kind of share on the discussions with Regal
and how you're thinking about the bankruptcy and the kind of risk to your assets.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Josh, it's really not in the sense that we're -- it's a legal process. We're actively engaged. It doesn't -- it's not good for us to negotiate on
an open line like this without our partner being part of it. We've said before, we feel that we have an above-average Regal portfolio. As
coverages indicate that the industry is recovering, we -- I appreciate that everyone's questions and concerns and wanting resolution of
this sooner rather than later and wanting to know more details about it, it's just something that until we're considerably further in this
process, we're really not able to discuss.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Is there a way you can kind of handicap like the time frame that we might be able to kind of hear some like further details on? How long
do these processes typically take?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Again, I would love to tell you that there is a defined, but if anybody has been involved in bankruptcy before, the debtor has a lot going
on. We know they have a significant number of landlords that they need to work with and work through. Again, I will tell you, we are
wanting to resolve this as expeditiously as we can. But with that said, we're really not in control of the time frame. They've got a lot of
interested parties, both on their capital -- their balance sheet side as well as landlords, that I think they're working through. And what I
can commit to you is as we get more clarity on our situation, we'll be glad to share that.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Okay. And how should we think about theater coverage as we head into 3Q? Because it's -- I know it's a 1-quarter lag. Is that going to dip
further, just based on the commentary on the, I guess, August to September?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
I think our -- I think if you look about -- and this is -- I'm going to quote kind of industry, and I'll ask Greg to say this, that was based upon
a $7.1 billion trailing 12 months. I think most people think that for the 12 months calendar year, that it will be higher than that number. So
overall box office should be higher. So hopefully, that portends to better than what we're showing right now, but Greg?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes, absolutely. I think overall box office will be higher. And Josh, if you look at the 3 films that are opening, Black Adam has performed
extremely strongly out of the gate and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is getting rave reviews. So we anticipate a really strong end of
the year.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.
 
Unidentified Analyst
So it's actually [Nick Kerr] on for Nick Joseph right now. And the question is on those 8% yields I think you mentioned. So is that across
the whole portfolio? And then specifically in the experiential portion, how do you see that trending in '23 and if there's any specific
verticals that deviate from that 8%?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Greg, I'll let you take that.
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes, Nick, I think -- it's generally across all of our verticals, the 8% cap rate. Some may be slightly under that, some may be slightly over
that. I don't think that we're seeing any meaningful compression in cap rates for sure in any of our verticals and we're seeing slight
expansion as the economy slows down. And again, we're not investing in any theaters, so -- or education. So all of our investments are in
our experiential portfolio.
 
Unidentified Analyst
And then just on if you guys are changing your underwriting assumptions on future capital commitments, given sort of where we stand
right now, any color on that would be appreciated.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
I think -- and I'll let Greg comment as well -- I think we've always approached these very conservatively. Again, we never really took into
consideration the kind of the bump of whether you call it revenge spending. We were underwriting to what we think are long-term trends.
I think there's always, as we go into a challenging environment, you probably add a tinge more conservatism. But remember, we're
generally leasing these for 15 to 20 years. So you're looking at this over a prolonged period of time in multiple economic cycles. So you're
always going to have standard deviations from your mean underwriting that you want to look at and stress those. But Greg?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
No, I think that's well put.
 
Operator
Next is Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. I guess just first on Regal. Can you give us what the annualized or monthly scheduled rent is? I know you gave like kind of a per
share and we can kind of back into a rough number, but just to kind of make sure we have the right figures there.
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes, it's about $7.1 million in terms of kind of regular rent and the deferral payment previously was about $1.5 million per month.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And that $1.5 million, that relates to, I think, the $92 million you said that they kind of owed and that they were chipping away at, is
that what that is?
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes, correct.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. Got it. I just wanted to understand that. And then just second, with regards to thinking about the guidance and the swing factor for
the rest of the year, the, I guess, $31 million difference between the $123 million and the $92 million related to Regal, is any of that
factored into the guide?
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Sorry, I'm not following. What number are you referring to, the $123 million?
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Yes, I think you said there was...
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Yes, I mean -- Yes, I think, Tony, if you look at the slide, what's factored in the guide, if you see, Mark, I thought did a really good job of
telling people what's in and out of the guide. So the rent is in, but the deferral for December is not in.
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Right. I see what you're saying. You took the $7.1 million and added the $1.5 million and you're talking about the whole thing. Yes, we
tried to lay that out, as Greg said, on the slide, where October, November regular rent and deferral payments are in the guide that we got
subsequent to the end of the quarter. And then regular rent for December, but not the deferral payment, because our policy with respect
to deferral payments is to not include until we have them in hand.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. I understand. Just -- sorry, I probably wasn't being very clear. Just beyond Regal now, just with the other potential deferred rent,
you might collect sort of the rest of that $123 million outside of Regal, none of that is contemplated in the guide right now?
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
So you see right below that on the same slide, non-Regal deferral payments, we did include $0.5 million in October and $0.5 million in
November that we've already received. That could be another $0.5 million for December that's not in our guidance, part of the upside
from the midpoint. But it's right below that, you see the non-Regal cash basis deferral payments on the slide, that's where that's
outlined.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Got it. And then just last question, just you mentioned yields at kind of 8% and I feel like they've been at 8% for a pretty long time. But
then you had also said reason to be disciplined was sort of this bid-ask spread. So just wondering like where -- what would get you to
deploy more capital, like is it 9%? Or is it in 8.5% or kind of like how big is that spread right now for you?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
I think, Tony, and I'll let Greg comment on this as well, we're very focused on what I would call relationship transactions where we're
supporting our existing tenants. Again, it's probably not that quarter point, but also what we feel will fuel future growth as we move
forward. Greg and his team are really good at negotiating kind of the ability to see a plethora of deals as we move beyond these
turbulent periods. So we're focused probably not on that next quarter point, but what helps fuel our pipeline as we move forward, either
through relationships or relationship agreements that give us access to more product as we get out of this kind of -- or get beyond this
turbulent period. But Greg?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. Tony, I think that's absolutely correct. I mean we're focused -- this year, we are expanding Pagosa; we bought Murrieta in
conjunction with our partner at Pagosa. We did additional financing in Alyeska. And going forward, there's a lot of focus on either
existing relationships or building new relationships. And I completely agree with Greg, that's more important to us than a quarter turn.
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from R.J. Milligan with Raymond James.
 
Richard Jon Milligan
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Research Analyst
We appreciate the updated coverage information. Greg, in the past, you've talked about the profitability of the Regal theaters relative to
the other Regal theaters in the country. And I was just curious if you could give any color on a coverage level for those specific assets or at
least comment if they're running in trend with the rest of the portfolio when that coverage is above 2019 levels.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Again, I think, well, the coverages on all theaters are not above 2019 levels, let's be clear. What we've tried to say is -- and first of all, I
think we do have an above-average Regal portfolio. So on average, yes, I think they're running better than most Regals and they're, in
fact, probably as a percent outperforming there, what was their percentage of the box office in 2019. When we look at -- we look at
coverages now, what we talked about earlier, if you recall, was coverage about a 1.0 kind of breakeven at around the $6 billion. And we
had said at the levels we thought we would be at 1.25 to 1.35 on where things were being predicted on where box office.
Again, I think this points to how well we understand and Greg and his team understands that industry to indicate kind of where we're
landing out. I also think that it points to that the theater business is healthier than people think, even at these reduced levels. I believe
there were a lot of investors, when we spoke to them, that they thought coverages were like below 1 at these levels, and we're showing
that it's not -- we don't have to necessarily get back to $11 billion to have a healthy portfolio, because of the strength of our portfolio. And
I think that's the message we wanted to convey, but Greg?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. And to be clear, R.J., the coverage is 1.3x against a $7.1 billion trailing 12, and in 2019, it was 1.7x against an $11.4 billion box office.
And as we said earlier, we do expect box office to continue its recovery. And through the year, the trailing 12-month number is probably a
little low for the full year.

Got it. And then we've heard from some of your peers, more of on a one-off basis, about the ability to re-tenant some of these theaters.
I'm just curious, what's the demand out there, from either local operators or national operators, to take on or re-tenant what were
profitable locations?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Again, I think there's going to be -- this isn't a [set], but it's location by location. I mean I think Greg and his team this year, we've done a
really good job of transferring theaters to non-theaters and selling off for other uses, as we've talked about on previous calls. I think good
locations, there's always going to be demand because most of the operators and the studios see this business recovering. Recent
announcements by a lot of studios have continued to reiterate that the streaming model is really just a replacement for the networks and
that this is -- they need films to perform well in theaters to generate excess cash flow. So I think it's just, as we've talked about before,
production ramping back up and getting back to a level that works, but everybody through this testing period has seen the power of it.
But Greg, I don't know...?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
No, I think that's right. The only thing I would add is that Paramount just earlier this week reaffirmed that the best model for them
economically is theatrical release to streaming.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Theatrical release first, then to streaming.
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes, with a window, sorry. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
I know last quarter, you guys were pretty optimistic about the 2023 box office. I know there has been some reshuffling with some Marvel
movies being delayed and I think there's a Star Wars movie that was delayed. I mean how should we think about that? Does that reduce
the optimism for 2023? Or is that just kind of normal things that we should typically expect, just given that we're so far out still from
some of those movies being released?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Yes. And I think there's a lot of moving things. It's never -- just to be candid, it's never great to see what you think is a big title moving out
of a year into a different year. But we're still kind of in the early stages of how 2023 will look. So I don't think that -- I think we still think
there's -- there can be improvement and -- but it's -- as we've said before, it's getting better. It's just not quickly getting better. It's
gradually in building the growth.
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. It just takes time to restart the pipeline. And clearly, Hollywood is in the midst of doing that. And I think you'll see continued
ramp-up through '23 into '24, Michael.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
And Greg Zimmerman, you were kind of highlighting, obviously, several movie titles. Is there a good way for us to think about like how
many tent-pole-type films do we need to see a quarter or a year for that to be a good -- for a good box office year? Or is there a way that
we can think about that?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. Probably the best metric is we are probably down about 50% in total titles this year. So as that number of title increases -- titles
increase, the box office will increase. That's the real issue.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then if I can just sneak 1 more in there. Can you talk a little bit about that coverage ratio highlighted? I know you have several
tenants. I mean historically, I think that EPR's line was that all your tenants were right around that average coverage number. I mean is
that true today? I mean how big is that band of those individual tenants right around that average coverage number?
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Again, there is dispersion. It's -- again, I think we think on a relative basis of the performance of our properties, that it's all fairly strong.
Getting into specific coverages is very, very -- at least as we're dealing with Regal right now, something that we'd rather not do because
we're, for specific information, it becomes a little problematic. But like I said, overall, the calculation that we did in 2019 and how we
talked about it then is the exact same way as it is right now.

Our next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann.
 
John James Massocca
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - Associate
Just to clarify, the high end of the new guidance range contemplates -- count all of the rent and deferral payments from cash basis
tenants, correct? Did I hear that right?
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes, correct. That's part of what can contribute to the upside, along with the fact we may get a portion of September's rent that we didn't
collect yet.
 
John James Massocca
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - Associate
And if I'm thinking about this guidance at the high end versus prior guidance, what amount of kind of cash rent and deferral payment
was contemplated in that prior high end number?
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Well....
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Well, no deferral -- cash basis deferral payments were -- unless they had been received.
 
Mark Alan Peterson
EPR Properties - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Right. We didn't -- we just did not include -- so previously, in our guidance at the end of June, we counted only deferral payments
through June and in our guidance, upper brand and lower end, did not contemplate deferral payments, okay? Now we've moved to third
quarter we're including, just because we want to talk about what we received subsequent to end of the quarter, particularly with respect
to Regal, so we're including what we've received not only through September, but also October, November.
So the upside to our guidance now, since we are kind of dealing with post quarter end deferral payments, really becomes the Regal
deferral for 1 month, which is $1.5 million for December and $0.5 million for the non-Regal customers for the month of December. And as
I mentioned, there's the September rent payment out there that in our midpoint of guidance, we don't anticipate getting, but we could
get a portion of that yet this year. So that contributes to the upside. And then along with the fact that we do have managed properties
and so forth, that there's a band that those could come in at, high or low, which impacts the guidance as well.
 
John James Massocca
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - Associate
Okay. Then switching gears a little bit, the Murrieta, California investment, apologies if I missed that in the prepared remarks, but how is
that investment structured? Is that a net lease initially? Or is that going to be in kind of a JV or operator model? Just kind of how are you
looking at that investment from a structure perspective?
 
Gregory E. Zimmerman
EPR Properties - Executive VP & CIO
Yes, John, it's a sale leaseback.
 
John James Massocca
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - Associate
Okay, that clears that up, all right.
 
Operator
That was our final question. So I would now like to turn it back over to Greg Silvers for some closing remarks.
 
Gregory K. Silvers
EPR Properties - CEO & Chairman
Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for your time and attendance. I want to reiterate, again, I appreciate and understand that we have a
lot of questions that go on about our theater portfolio, but as we've met with many of you, we've talked about the strength, the resiliency,
of our non-theater kind of experiential portfolio. And as these coverages today, we talked about those properties were doing incredibly
well, and that coverage indicates. We're talking about moving from 2.2x to 2.8x overall. And remember, that still represents 62% of our
portfolio. So with that, I appreciate your time and attention and we look forward to talking at our year-end call. Thank you.
