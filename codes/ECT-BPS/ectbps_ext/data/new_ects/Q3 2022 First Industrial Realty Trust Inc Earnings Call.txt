Good morning, and welcome to the First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. Third Quarter Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
Please note that this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Art Harmon, Vice President of Investor Relations and Marketing. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Arthur J. Harmon
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - VP of IR & Marketing
Thank you, Cole, and hello, everybody, and welcome to our call. Before we discuss our third quarter 2022 results and our updated
guidance for the year, let me remind everyone that our call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.
These statements are based on management's expectations, plans and estimates of our prospects. Today's statements may be time
sensitive and accurate only as of today's date, October 20, 2022. We assume no obligation to update our statements or the other
information we provide. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements and factors which could cause this are
described in our 10-K and other SEC filings.
You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our supplemental report and our earnings
release. The supplemental report, earnings release and our SEC filings are available at firstindustrial.com under the Investors tab.
Our call will begin with remarks by Peter Baccile, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Musil, our Chief Financial Officer.
After that, we'll open it up for your questions. Also on the call today are Jojo Yap, our Chief Investment Officer; Peter Schultz, Executive
Vice President; Chris Schneider, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Bob Walter, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Asset
Management.
Now let me turn the call over to Peter.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Art, and thank you all for joining us today. Our team delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by continued leasing
success in our portfolio, including the exceptional rental rate growth we are capturing on lease signings related to 2023 expirations,
which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
We also started several new developments, including 3 buildings at our Phoenix joint venture, where we continue to build upon our
success in the 303 logistics corridor. Due to our strong operating results, we're increasing the midpoint of our full year FFO per share
guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Scott will walk you through the details during his remarks.
Fundamentals in the industrial real estate market continued to support further market rent growth. According to CBRE, industrial
vacancy was just 2.9% at the end of the third quarter. Third quarter net absorption was 81 million square feet versus completions of 101
million. For the first 9 months of 2022, net absorption was 319 million square feet exceeding completions of 255 million square feet.
In our core portfolio, we finished the quarter with an occupancy rate of 98.3% and cash same-store NOI growth of 8.5%.
We continue to achieve strong overall rental rate increases on our new and renewal leasing. Through yesterday, we have taken care of
approximately 98% of our 2022 rollovers. And when combined with our new leases signed with 2022 commencements, our overall cash
rental rate change is 25%. With just a handful of 2022 rollovers remaining, we are set to achieve an annual company rental rate growth
record for the third time in 4 years.
Given the strong fundamentals in our business, our regional teams continue to push rental rates on new and renewal leasing for 2023
expirations. As of last night, we have taken care of 38% of next year's lease expirations at a cash rental rate increase of 28%.
Our current outlook for the remainder of the 2023 rollovers is even better. For the remaining 2023 lease expirations, approximately 36%
of net rent is from Southern California versus a 24% net rent weighting for SoCal in our overall portfolio. We'll give you an updated view
of our projected 2023 cash rental rate change on our fourth quarter call when we have completed our budget review.
We have also been successful in pushing contractual rental rate escalators in our leases. Our new and renewal leases with 2023
commencements, our average annual escalator is 3.6%. With respect to new development leasing, our tenant at the 219,000 square-foot
Building 1 at First Park Miami is doubling their space and will occupy the entire building, which will deliver in the first quarter. We also
preleased 43,000 square feet at one of the 4 buildings at our 344,000 square-foot First Loop Logistics Park in Orlando.
Moving to our new development investments. In the Inland Empire, we started the 155,000 square-foot First Wilson Logistics Center II,
which is adjacent to our first development there that we successfully leased in advance of completion. Our estimated investments for the
sister building is $29 million with a projected cash yield of 10.5%, reflecting our attractive basis and the extraordinary rent growth in
Southern California since we sourced this site.
Including this start, our developments in process totaled 3.7 million square feet with an investment of $571 million. The projected cash
yield for these investments is 7.4%, which represents an expected overall development margin of approximately 78%. The margin
calculation now reflects a cap rate adjustment of approximately 100 basis points relative to our assumptions prior to the end of Q1.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are launching a new project in our Camelback 303 joint venture in Phoenix. This follows the
land sale we completed last quarter that netted us north of $100 million in gain and promote. The JV is developing 3 speculative
distribution facilities totaling 1.8 million square feet. The total projected GAAP cost of all 3 buildings is approximately $210 million and
the targeted cash yield is approximately 5.7%. The venture is using construction financing for a portion of the total project cost. So our
share of incremental cash out-of-pocket spend for these developments is only about $20 million.
On the acquisition side, in the third quarter, we acquired a relatively even proportion of land sites and existing buildings totaling $84
million. All were in coastal markets, including Southern California, Miami and Seattle.
With these new development site additions, we continue to be well positioned to support future growth with landholdings that can
accommodate an additional 14 million square feet. This represents approximately $2 billion of potential new investments based on
today's estimated construction cost and the land at our book basis.
Lastly, consistent with our strategic objective to derive 95% of rental income from 15 key logistics markets by the end of 2023, we sold
the remainder of our holdings in Cleveland. The sale price was $107 million, which equates to approximately a 6.4% in-place cap rate on
the sale.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to provide additional details on third quarter performance and update you on guidance.
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Thanks, Peter. Let me recap our results for the quarter. NAREIT funds from operations were $0.60 per fully diluted share compared to
$0.51 per share in 3Q 2021. As Peter noted, we finished the quarter with in-service occupancy of 98.3%, which is up 120 basis points
compared to the year ago quarter.
Our cash same-store NOI growth for the quarter, excluding termination fees, was 8.5%, primarily driven by higher average occupancy,
increases in rental rates on new and renewal leasing and rental rate bumps embedded in our leases.
Summarizing our leasing activity during the quarter, approximately 3.3 million square feet of leases commenced. Of these, 700,000
were new, 1.2 million were renewals and 1.5 million were for developments and acquisitions with lease-up. Tenant retention by square
footage was 65%.
Moving on to the capital side. In August, we announced the closing of a new $300 million delayed draw term loan with a tenor of 3 years
plus 2 one-year extensions, the proceeds from which will approximate the remaining costs to complete our current developments. The
delayed draw feature allows us to borrow on this facility for up to one year from the date of closing. The new term loan has an interest
rate of SOFR plus a credit spread of 85 basis points plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 or 15 basis points depending on the tenor of the
interest period. As of today, we have not drawn down any funds from this facility.
Moving on to our updated 2022 guidance per our earnings release last evening. Our guidance range for NAREIT FFO per share is now
$2.21 to $2.25 with the midpoint of $2.23. This is an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. The
increase is primarily due to better portfolio performance and an increase in capitalized interest due to our developments.
Key assumptions for guidance are as follows: in-service occupancy at year-end of 98% to 98.5%. This implies a full-year quarter-end
average in-service occupancy of 98.2% to 98.3%. Our occupancy guidance now reflects our 644,000 square-foot Old Post Road building
in Baltimore will be occupied in the first quarter of 2023 based on the conversations we are having with our leasing prospects.
Fourth quarter same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 5% to 6.5%. This implies a quarterly average
same-store NOI growth for the full year 2022 of 9.3% to 9.7%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint compared to our prior
earnings call. Guidance includes the anticipated 2022 costs related to our completed and under construction developments at
September 30.
For the full year 2022, we expect to capitalize about $0.12 per share of interest, $0.02 higher than our prior guidance. And our G&A
expense guidance remains unchanged at $34 million to $35 million. Other than previously discussed, our guidance does not reflect the
impact of any other future sales, acquisitions or new development starts, the impact of any future debt issuances, debt repurchases or
repayments, and guidance also excludes the potential issuance of equity.
Let me now turn it back over to Peter.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Scott. Industrial fundamentals remain strong, supporting high occupancy and rent growth, even while the financial markets sort
through rising interest rates, high inflation and extreme volatility. Our team is working day and night to serve continuing tenant demand
with new best-in-class projects and drive long-term cash flow growth and value for shareholders.
Operator, with that, please open it up for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question today will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Scott, can you talk about the guidance and the implied 4Q FFO guidance of $0.54, if you can just help us bridge the gap between $0.60
you reported and $0.54 in 4Q as expected.
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Yes. Ki Bin, I hope you're doing well. Absolutely. I'll provide that. There's 3 main areas that are impacting the drop of our FFO per share
from 4Q to 3Q. $0.01 of that is due to one-time items that we recognized in the third quarter related to NOI. So that could be tax
true-ups, tax rebates we received or easement income.
So 3Q has $0.01 of one-time items that we are not recognizing in 4Q. $0.02 has to do with the third quarter property sales. Those
happened in late September. And then another $0.02 of that has to do with an increase in interest expense, primarily on our line of
credit. So those are the 3 main drivers for the drop of our FFO from 3Q to 4Q.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. Great. And a macro question for you guys. We've seen some major banks, especially the bulge bracket starting to pull back from
commercial real estate lending, which has led to some chopping of banks participating in some of the REIT credit facilities. So some of
this might be due to the government stress testing how CRE loans are treated. So I'm just curious from your case, especially like Scott,
you've been the CFO at FR a long time and Peter, you had a great -- interesting background in banking at JPMorgan. So I'm curious
about your take on all this, what you're seeing and how this might all play out.
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Well, Ki Bin, I would say that the bank term loan market is drying up. I think our deal that we inked in the middle of August is probably
one of the last deals that you're going to see for a while. I think you're right, a lot of it has to do with stress tests that banks are
undergoing in the third or fourth quarter. So my guess is that market is going to be closed probably for the next couple of quarters.
Maybe it opens up in early 2023. And I have a feeling, if I was a bank, I would probably increase the spreads a bit though, compared to
what our deal was that we closed in August. So Peter, if you have anything to add.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I think at a macro level, if you were to ask the CEOs of these big banks, they would express significant frustration with how high the
capital requirements are. It effectively takes them out of the market at a time when their customers need them most. And so that's -- I
know that's a point of frustration after some conversations I've had with some of those people. Bob, do you want to talk about the
availability of construction finance too?
 
Robert J. Walter
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - SVP of Capital Markets & Asset Management
Yes. I would say availability, frankly, is kind of the key right now. We're seeing a lot of banks clearly pull back, Kin Bin, as you alluded to,
through at least year-end on even looking at new business and heard a lot of stories of people -- of banks pulling term sheets that they
had outstanding. So availability for construction financing is key and very difficult right now.
 
Operator
And our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Given those comments, how would you characterize the market for dispositions today, presumably, the assets you sold in the third
quarter were marketed a while back? What's the sort of pricing today and what's your appetite to do more dispositions over the next few
quarters in the current environment?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. Yes, I mean, we're very pleased with the execution we got on Cleveland and the team did a great job in what obviously is a rapidly
changing investment sales market. We do have appetite for additional dispositions. It just depends on what we find when we go out with
assets in terms of pricing. This is good real estate at the end of the day. It's very solid. It's, by and large, 100% leased. So we're not going
to be letting the stuff go cheap.
We'll see where the markets are. We do know that there are literally billions of dollars of new funds coming into the space, looking to
gain exposure. Funds are forming as we speak for this purpose. I'm not sure if they're forming because they think there's going to be
distress or not. But given the size of the dollars involved, I have to believe they expect regular way, what I would call, regular way
purchases. So yes, we have appetite for sales, and we think there's going to be a lot of capital out there. We'll just have to see what the
pricing looks like.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. And then I guess the alternative here. The expected stabilized cap rate on the current development pipeline is 7.4. When you factor
in land costs today, current development costs and current rents, where do you think the projects that you're going to start in the next 6
to 12 months are going to average out? About the same, a little bit skinnier on the yields, a little bit better on the yields, how is that likely
to flush out?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
So Jojo, you want to comment on that?
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Well, thanks for quoting that number. We're very, very pleased about the profitability and the margins and accretiveness on those
projects because they clearly are great sites as well. So the function of that is rising rates and our real good basis. We actually have not
done in -- we don't -- we haven't done mark-to-market kind of computation of that. What we report is what we as a company and
shareholders are going to get based on our basis. But what -- I mean, the fair market values of the land today are, of course, are higher in
our basis. So the cap rate is going to be lower than [7.4], but we haven't really done that math.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. And for stuff that you're going to start, I mean, is it -- I mean, if we're sitting here a year from now, is the cap rate -- the expected
stabilized cap rate on that development pipeline about the same, a little bit less, a little bit more, how do you characterize that when
you're looking at where development costs are going and your ability to lock in pricing on materials and labor today as well as what's --
whether or not there's been any increased softness on land or whether or not land is still very expensive, et cetera? How does that sort of
play out?
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Yes, well, it's really hard to forecast yield. So we'll report to you once we are ready to start development, where our projected yields are, I
think that's a more accurate way because there's various variables like you mentioned, building cost and where the rents are. But one
thing I will tell you is that if you look at our land holdings, in almost every market, rents have increased and are increasing faster than
construction costs. And so if it actually stays the same, then the yields would be very attractive. But again, we'll give you a sense when we
start new projects.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Don't forget, Rob, we've got about $2 billion of investment opportunity in our current landholdings. So the yields, as Jojo points out,
are difficult to project right now. But with rents growing the way they are, we certainly like our prospects.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. And then one last one for Scott. The term loan basically removes the need for you to access the debt markets in the foreseeable
future? Or are you going to be looking to do anything over the next 6 months until things sort of calm down?
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Rob, I would say a couple of things. From a debt maturity point of view, we have nothing coming due till 2026, assuming you give us
credit for the options, extension options we have in our line. The development spend that we need to complete our developments is
about $350 million. And when you look at the liquidity we have in our line of credit, the term loan, which is $300 million undrawn and
cash flow earned next year, it's about $700 million. So it's about double of what the requirements are needed to complete the
developments and that doesn't even include any sales proceeds. So I think we're in very good shape from a liquidity point of view.
 
Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Real Estate Research & Senior
Research Analyst
Okay. So more than enough to fund any sort of first half of '23's development starts?
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Absolutely.
 
Operator
And our next question will come from Dave Rodgers with Baird.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
I wanted to follow up, Peter, on your comments in your opening remarks about just kind of the financial market sorting out inflation and
higher interest rates. I guess I wanted to get your thoughts maybe on just the overall economic environment and positioning potentially
for any type of recession.
You obviously have the speculative leasing cap, which is good or the investment cap. But talk about kind of how you want to position the
company for a potential slowdown in activity, whether that cap gets reduced further or whether you might want to just have more slack in
that or even taking that to the next step, are you seeing any reasons to be more cautious as you look forward?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Right now, all of the markets that we're targeting are pretty tight. There's unmet demand. So the fundamentals remain strong. Clearly,
we're keeping a close eye on what's going on with the rest of the economy. So we're juggling like everyone else, what we think is coming
in the way of consumption on the consumer side as well as the volatility in the capital markets. With respect to our cap, we're really not
focused on the cap. Remember the cap is just that a cap and not a target. Our geographic functionality and risk-adjusted return
requirements drive our investment decisions, not the level of the cap.
So we're very pleased that we have this great growth opportunity on the balance sheet today. But of course, we're going to be driven
primarily by that risk-adjusted return opportunity and what happens in the broader market. In terms of positioning the company, we have
a rock-solid balance sheet. We're going to maintain that rock-solid balance sheet, and we're going to fund ourselves properly and adjust
our growth as the market requires.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Maybe as a second point of that, are you seeing any reasons that you would want to slow down development or be more cautious
whether that's kind of gestation time of leases or just fewer people showing up for those leasing negotiations than maybe a year ago?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, the number of prospects that we have looking at our new opportunities is significant. Comparing it to, say, 6 or 9 months ago, it
would clearly be a tough comp. Those were the best days probably in the history of this business. But we don't really see any reason right
now to slow down per se. We're excited about what we have in the way of prospects and the opportunities that are out there to capture
this tremendous rent growth in the coastal markets and the value creation that comes from it.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Great. And then maybe just last for me and going back to Old Post Road. It looks like it was delayed to the first quarter. Is there more
clarity around the first quarter? Or is that just not happening in the fourth quarter?
 
Peter O. Schultz
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP
Sure, David. It's Peter Schultz. So our discussions with our prospects continue. As we talked about on our last call, our expectation was
occupancy would happen in the fourth quarter. The primary prospects are both third-party logistics providers and their discussions with
their customers are simply taking longer.
There is certainly the possibility that it happens in this quarter, but we think it's more likely at this point that it's the first quarter or so.
And in our estimation was prudent to make that adjustment. Having said all that, the building is positioned for immediate occupancy,
and tenants continue to have very few choices in that submarket. So it's on us to get this done and the team is very focused on.
 
Operator
And our next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
This is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Just looking at the dispositions, there was a 60 basis point increase in cap rates in Q3 versus 2021.
How much of this increase reflects Cleveland versus just general market rate increases? And if you could also comment on potential cap
rate expansion more broadly, that would be appreciated.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I'll start this and Jojo and Peter can jump in. In terms of cap rate movements more broadly, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, we
for our own purposes in terms of looking at margins have increased our cap rate assumption by about 100 basis points. When it comes to
a discussion of cap rates, it's really a submarket-by-submarket conversation. Certainly, in the fastest-growing submarkets, i.e., fastest
growing rents in, say, Southern California, cap rates haven't moved a whole lot. And in other markets, they've moved more.
Jojo, you want to...
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
I mean it's a different mix. So it's really, like Peter said, you can't really compare quarter-to-quarter because there's a mix of different
product and different weighted average lease terms, different occupancies and different submarkets. So I wouldn't compare
quarter-to-quarter because, in fact, it's not really that efficient. But again, we're very pleased with the execution we did in Cleveland, and
we'll be able to reallocate that to higher rent growth markets.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then just touching on those margins in the development pipeline. Has underwriting been adjusted in any other way besides
that kind of 100 basis point increase that you spoke about? And then also, if you could just touch on what cap rates you're actually using,
especially thinking Inland Empire versus elsewhere, that would be appreciated.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Our underwriting hasn't really changed. We're still using the same conservative, or at least what we think is conservative, inputs in terms
of 12-month leasing downtime and moderated rent growth versus what we're seeing in the markets. Cap rates...
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Yes, basically, so absolutely the same underwriting. If you just do the math, I mean, it's there, right there in terms of our investment and
our reported margin, it imputes to a low 4 cap rate. And I just want to emphasize, and you probably know this already because it's right
there, about 62% to 63% of development pipeline that you're seeing is Florida and SoCal, which has boast one of the lowest cap rates in
the nation. So we're very pleased with this pipeline. We've not had this high of a concentration in 2 of the most active markets in the U.S.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
And just to make sure I understand. So you're basically saying that like that, I think it calculates a 4.2 cap rate would be the exit cap rate
in kind of Florida -- sorry, Southern Florida and Inland Empire?
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Yes, it will be lower because that only comprises 62%. So the 62% in Florida and SoCal is a component of that low 4.15 cap rate. And so
SoCal, Florida would be lower and the rest of the 32% or 33% would be a little bit higher.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. I mean honestly, it seems a bit low based on debt cost, but I'm sure you guys know the market much better than I do.
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
A couple of points on that, a lot of investors, especially the most active ones today are the low leverage -- lower leverage investors, and
they're looking at total return. They're looking -- the market is looking for a total return of maybe 6.5% to 7.5%. And clearly, given the
rent growth in these markets that I mentioned, you can exceed those with those cap rates.
 
Operator
And our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
I just wanted to touch on the '23 expirations where you made significant progress and mentioned that the cash rent spreads bumped up
to 28% from 20% on the last update last quarter for what's been signed. And you indicated that the spreads would actually get better.
Any sense of what you're projecting for the balance of the expirations, what you're seeing in the Southern California portfolio there and
sort of what you're projecting for the year in terms of rent change, if you could maybe sort of book end it a little bit?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
The potential uplift there is pretty significant. We haven't finished our budgets and that's why we're not going to put numbers out there.
But I think what would give you a pretty good indication is for Jojo to talk about the last few leases that we signed, so that you can see
what we're achieving.
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Yes. Thanks, Peter. So the most recent leases in LA/IE that we've done, there's 3 leases, 2 in South Bay and 1 in IE and the square footage
range from 40,000 feet to 140,000 feet. And the rent change on those leases were from -- the range was 90% to over 200%, rent
change, cash.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And is that sort of indicative of what we should think about for that portion of the expirations, which I think you said Southern
California represents about 36%, is that right?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
These are three examples. You'll have to come up with your own thoughts on what it's going to look like. We can't really guide on that.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Got it. And then, Scott, so tenant recoveries were up meaningfully in the quarter. Your expense reimbursement ratio was up almost, I
think, 500 or 600 basis points around 89%. I think you mentioned there were some tax true-ups in the quarter. Was that -- was the
increase solely related to those true-ups? Or is that going to revert back to, call it, 83%, 84%? Or is some of that increase perhaps
sustainable?
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Yes. When you look at 3 months and 9-month, same-store expenses were up. What I would say, Todd, is due to the fact that we're highly
occupied at over 98%, pretty much almost dollar for dollar, we recovered back. So there hasn't been much leakage on that. As far as next
year is concerned, you're probably going to see some pressure on real estate taxes like we have for the last couple of years one the way
up. But we'll have a better idea of that in our fourth quarter call. But I think the one point you want to take away is that the increase in
expenses, again, was pretty much recovered dollar for dollar from our tenants because of the net lease structure.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then just sticking with NOI or same-store NOI growth, I realize you have a difficult comp in the fourth quarter. You have
a couple of difficult comps coming up. But can you talk about that a little bit? And I realize you're not providing '23 guidance, but maybe
some insight around the trajectory of same-store NOI growth here as we sort of think about the next few quarters and sort of how the
year starts out maybe. I guess, Old Post Road is may be a factor, but I'm really curious just given the volatility in that metric for you and
sort of what you're seeing potentially.
 
Christopher M. Schneider
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Senior VP of Operations & Chief Information Officer
Yes. This is Chris. I think you're first referring to kind of the deceleration from 3Q to 4Q. If you look at 4Q, our midpoint is 5.75%, which
represents about 275 basis point decrease. It's really due to 150 basis points due to some free rent burn off and some free rent given on
some of the larger new leases.And then the other 100 basis points is really a swing on, Scott kind of mentioned about some real estate
tax refunds and true-ups that happened in the third quarter. So that swing from 3Q to 4Q is about 100 basis points difference.
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
And then, Todd, when you look at 2023, this is not guidance because we got to still go through our budgets. But I'm not going to
comment about occupancy. So we still have to go through that. We talked about the Old Post Road that we leased that up by the first
quarter. Free rent, we'll have to see how that burnout works out. But if you look at the other 2 main components of rental rate bumps and
rental rate increases on new and renewal leases, I'm just using roughly a 30% increase next year of cash run rates, which we talked about
in our script. We think it's going to be higher than that, you're at least going to have a six handle just from those two components for
same-store. And again, we'll update you on a fuller number that takes into account occupancy and free rent burn off on our fourth
quarter call.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC.
 
Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. So back to the capital raising question. So you did the delayed draw. And I know you ran through the math, the debt maturities are
nonexistent for a while and you went through the development spend. But are you sort of lining up some options, say, 6 to 12 months
from now, assuming the world does indeed come to an end, and these forms of capital start to become lesser elements to the story? Is
joint venture partnerships, is more in the way of dispositions sort of on the horizon, at least thinking about it now to be prepared for
whatever might come our way 6 to 12 months from now?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Certainly, we're going to be opportunistic and consider all forms of potential capital raising across the spectrum. Obviously, if the world
comes to end, we won't be investing anyway. So...
 
Unidentified Company Representative
We wouldn't be pricing for (inaudible)
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
But thinking about a darker scenario, we have spent the last dozen years creating a rock-solid portfolio. From a credit standpoint, I think
2020 was reflective of how strong that is in terms of the fact that we collected all of our rents during COVID, that COVID year, and I'm not
sure anybody else did.
And we've got this rock solid balance sheet with plenty of debt service coverage and access to all forms of capital. For us, it's trying to
arbitrage those forms of capital to make sure we're funding ourselves as cheaply as possible. That's really the game plan.
 
Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
And/or slowing down the development starts business, obviously, would be the option?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We don't feel that's the case now. But certainly, that would happen if, as you point out, darker days come.
 
Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Right. Second question, I think as Jojo mentioned something like 100% rent change on some areas of the country, which is great, but also
a vestige of what has happened over the past few years. I mean how are you monitoring this in terms it just kind of flushing itself out of
the system with each passing renegotiation, re-leasing event.
Do you see that you have multiple years ahead of you of well ahead of trend type of cash re-leasing spreads? Or is this something that
maybe has a shorter sort of shelf-life to it at this point and may start to think about guiding the communication down a little bit so that
people aren't over their skis from an expectation standpoint?
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
I think he's talking about cash rental rate increases in '24 or '25.
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Well, our job is to with our quality properties is really to get the best economics from each deal. And a lot of the rent growth is really a
function of supply-demand. And so for example, if you go to the Inland Empire and LA, demand is very, very strong and continues to be --
forecast to be strong. And then you have that and you then juxtapose that with the lowest vacancy rate in the whole U.S. at 0.5% and in
some markets 0.2%, then what you have is tenants don't have options really and now they have to pay the rent.
And also remember, long term, today, real estate really only comprises anywhere from 5% to 6% of total logistics cost. So if a third-party
logistics provider or e-commerce company, all the other users need the service, our costs pale in comparison to transportation cost and
labor. But they still need the real estate. So of course, that varies market by market, but that's what we're charged to do. We always
monitor to keep an eye on supply-demand.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
And don't forget, where we start today is completely different from where we started as an industry, say, before the Great Recession.
We're at 2.9% vacant. Back then, we were closer to 8%. Everybody's portfolio today is much better than their portfolios were back then.
We have recurring cash flow, which back then it was really cash flow in quotes from the sales of assets. So we're in a much better position
right now to weather any kind of a storm. And as Jojo pointed out, tenants don't have alternatives still today, and there's unmet demand,
especially in the coastal markets, and that's where we're focused.
 
Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Well, I mean, I guess I would say using that history lesson, there's the potential that vacancy rates can go up substantially as you just
pointed out, 8% versus 3%. Using that history, are you stress testing the model at all about, obviously, things were different. There was
much more spec development back then. But do you look at how FR performed 10, 12 years ago and try to sort of draw some conclusions
of where things could go now? Or is it just apples to oranges in your opinion?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
It is apples to oranges, but a couple of thoughts on that. One of the things that we saw back then, so this is '08/'09 is that the vacancy
rate had to get pretty high before the balance of power, if you will, between landlord and tenant changed. And that's kind of low 90s.
And that would be in a specific portfolio.
So we're obviously a long way from that. So that gives us confidence that this rent growth that we're seeing is going to continue for some
time. Don't forget, e-commerce today is a much, much bigger component of the equation than it was back then. And that is a bit of an
economy within the economy, if you will.

And our next question will come from Anthony Powell with Barclays.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
I have a couple of questions on the developments that are completed but not in service, just in Colorado and Tennessee that aren't
leased yet. How are your conversations with tenants around those assets? And generally, in the development pipeline, should we expect
a bit more downtime between completion and leasing given kind of the environment here?
 
Peter O. Schultz
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP
So this is Peter. So I would first say that overall demand continues to be very good across our development pipeline, both completed and
under construction, as Jojo commented earlier, multiple prospects on most of our spaces. To your specific questions on the buildings that
are completed. So in Nashville, we're trading paper with a prospect there. In Denver, that's in our Park. And our experience in Denver is
activity picks up as the building is completed, and we've seen exactly that. A couple of fresh RFPs and proposals out there. And then
lastly, in Miami at our First Park Miami, we have only 66,000 square feet remaining in what's completed, and we have a lease out on that
space as well. Jojo, do you want to talk about Seattle?
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Sure yes. Yes in Seattle, we are responding to proposals back and forth with multiple prospects. And just in your comment on downtime,
we've not changed our underwriting to one year. On average, we've been beating that. We're well, well inside of one year, closer to half of
that. And in terms of adjusting, you know what, it's -- we will not forecast where it will end up, but we have comfort in terms of our
underwriting of giving it a year.
But I will mention to you in terms of the development pipeline, you'll see about 64% of that in dollar volume is not scheduled to be
completed until 2023. So we have plenty of time and already, we're getting inquiries on that. And remember, again, like I mentioned --
what we've mentioned -- our team have mentioned, about 62% of that pipeline is in the tight markets of Florida and IE.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
And maybe just generally, obviously, you're pretty positive on the demand and its outlook. Has anything changed over the past 3 months
in terms of tenant demand, tours or just commentary around the tenant? It seems like things haven't, but maybe a broader discussion
about that and how you think that may evolve in the next several weeks. I know you can't predict the future 100%, but it sounds like
things are still pretty good.
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
You're getting into pretty micro time frame given the long life assets that we have here. I know what you're trying to get at. No, the mood
or the tone hasn't changed. By the way, big companies take a long time to make decisions. That's just the way it is. So that hasn't
changed either. And -- but we haven't seen a change in the tone or the mood. There's still a sense of urgency on the part of anyone who
didn't grow in '20 and '21 to grow now -- I mean to grow the supply chain and their footprint now. And so the conversations are robust.
 
Peter O. Schultz
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - EVP
The other thing I'd add to that, Anthony, is as you think about tenants that have moved out of our portfolio, it's in many cases because
they need more space that we're not able to accommodate given our high occupancy level. And we've, for the most part, backfilled those
spaces very, very quickly at much higher rents.
 
Operator
And our next question will come from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I think you mentioned you were getting about 3.6% rent bumps on the 2023 lease signings. How does that compare to what you
achieved on your 2022 signings? And then where does that put the overall portfolio kind of today?
 
Christopher M. Schneider
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Senior VP of Operations & Chief Information Officer
Yes. If you compare 2022, we get 3.3%. So that's up about 30 basis points to 2023. If you look at the in-place on the overall portfolio,
we're right now at about 2.9%. So obviously, those numbers are definitely increasing and going up.
 
Operator
And our next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James.
 
William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Any changes to the watch list on the tenant side, thoughts on bad debt reserve for next year?
 
Scott A. Musil
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO, Senior VP, Treasurer & Assistant Secretary
Bill, it's Scott. The bad debt expense for the third quarter was $188,000, so very low. Year-to-date, it's $25,000. That was aided by a
$250,000 payment for a prior reserve balance. No material tenants on the watch list. As far as next year is concerned, we're going
through our plans and our budgets. All depends on the economy, but where we stand today, no material issues of credit concern.
 
William Andrew Crow
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
You've talked a lot, for good reason about Southern California, Florida, some of those markets, Seattle. What about markets like Phoenix
and Texas as we look to next year in kind of the supply-demand balance? How do you see those markets playing out?
 
Peter E. Baccile
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Jojo, you want to take that?
 
Johannson L. Yap
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. - Co-Founder, CIO & Executive VP of West Region
Sure, Bill, it's Jojo. In terms of Dallas and Phoenix, they've actually performed really, really well this year. They brought in -- they're
actually the top 4 and 5 markets in terms of year-to-date net absorption. Dallas, 19 million square feet in net absorption year-to-date,
Phoenix 21 million.
Vacancy in Dallas is record low. In my 30 years of being in the business, it's never been this low, 3.8%. And in the last 30 years, Phoenix
has never been low -- this low vacancy rate of 2.7% in Phoenix, okay? So you have 2 markets right now that have robust in-migration and
with low vacancy rates. So that's the reason why Dallas and Phoenix have continued to have robust rent growth.
There is supply coming in. And one note on our building that we're building in Phoenix, we think we have the best product out there, bar
none and the most active market is the 303 corridor and if go you out there and ask everyone who has the best project out there is the 3
buildings that's First Industrial's building. So we were very proud of it.
From a highway exposure point of view, from a space plan point of view and access to how close it is to a 10 and 303 interchange. So by
and large, we'll be keeping an eye on the supply. But right now, the demand and the supply and the vacancy rates are all favorable for
Dallas and Phoenix.
