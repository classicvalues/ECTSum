Operator
Good morning. Thank you for attending today's Independence Realty Trust, Inc. Q3 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Forum, and I
will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)
It is now my pleasure to pass the conference over to our host, Lauren Torres.

Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Lauren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I would like to begin our call today by thanking our on-site teams, who
played an integral part in ensuring the safety of our residents and communities that felt the effects of Hurricane Ian in Florida and the
Carolinas. I'm happy to report that we did not experience any significant damage to any of our properties. And now on to our results. In
the third quarter, we delivered 11.5% combined same-store NOI growth and 33% core FFO per share growth on a year-over-year basis.
We attribute the strength to our portfolio concentration in non-gateway markets in the attractive Sunbelt region, where demand
continues to outweigh supply. In addition, we achieved double-digit average rental rate growth of 13.3% in the quarter. We continue to
balance occupancy and rental rate growth to maximize revenue for the long term. To that point, this rental rate growth, combined with
the start of 8 new value-add projects in the third quarter, put some pressure on occupancy but locked in attractive lease rates, generating
a strong revenue earning for 2023.
As of today, our occupancy is 95.4% in our non-value-add communities. Over the past quarter and as part of our capital recycling
strategy, we entered into agreements of sale for 2 communities, one in Louisville, Kentucky, and one in Terra Haute, Indiana. We also
acquired a community in Charlotte, North Carolina, and another in Tampa, Florida, expanding our footprint in these attractive markets.
and we entered into a joint venture for the development of a community in Las Colinas, Texas, which is part of the Dallas Fort Worth
Metropolitan area and is experiencing strong job growth and population migration.
These are all exciting opportunities to grow the portfolio in core IRT markets that have favorable fundamentals. We believe it is
important to be patient and selective as we allocate company capital in the current economic environment, and we'll only acquire new
communities or invest in joint ventures as part of our capital recycling strategy. We are also making progress with our value-add
program, having renovated 795 units this year and achieving a return on investment of 27.1%. While we remain excited about our
value-add program and the increased units to be added from our merger with STAR, we expect to moderate our plan in 2023 by delaying
the start of renovations at communities in new value-add markets until we have better clarity on the state of the economy. Currently, we
expect to complete between 2,500 and 3,000 units next year.
While acknowledging current macroeconomic uncertainty, we at IRT remain confident in our portfolio and strategy, that will enable us to
continue to drive outsized returns. Our confidence is underlying by the following: first, real estate fundamentals remain strong, and we're
encouraged about our position in the multifamily sector. Second, we have an optimal portfolio footprint across key Sunbelt markets that
continue to see significant migration in job growth, and we expect to outperform during all points of market cycles.
Third, this position of strength has been further bolstered by the STAR merger, which has added scale in our top markets as well
enhanced our operating platform. Fourth, as you can see with our performance year-to-date, we continue to successfully execute our
portfolio strategy, combining accretive leasing activity with progress on our value-add renovations and capital recycling initiatives, all of
which will ultimately drive long-term value for our business. And finally, all of this has been done while achieving the most robust
balance sheet in IRT's history, a true signal of strength as we move forward through the current operating environment. With all that
said, we're reiterating our full 2022 guidance that we previously raised for combined same-store NOI growth of 13.75% and core FFO per
share growth of 28%, each at the midpoint of our guided ranges. Looking forward, it is important to note that we expect 2023 to be a
year of continued NOI and core FFO per share growth, and we'll provide a more detailed outlook for the next year during our year-end
earnings call.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ella for an operational update.
 
Ella Shaw Neyland
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - COO & Director
Thank you, Scott. We delivered a solid third quarter, led by our ability to drive rent growth in our markets. As Scott mentioned, our
average rental rate increased 13.3% in Q3, which is even stronger than the 12% increase delivered in Q2 of this year. More specifically,
markets, where we saw the highest lease-over-lease effective rent growth in Q3, were Tampa at 22%, Myrtle Beach at 21%, Atlanta at
15%, and Dallas at 14%.
To put it in perspective, our markets with the lowest rent growth were Chicago, Birmingham, and Houston, but they were still averaging
9% to 10% rent growth in the quarter. These rental rate increases put some pressure on our Q3 occupancy levels, along with the addition
of 8 new properties, which started value-add renovations in the quarter. In response, we offered some upfront concessions to fill vacant
units and balance our occupancy goal with our rent growth goal. This was a strategic decision to lock in a higher rental rate as we head
into the end of the year and considering the economic uncertainty.
These efforts increased our occupancy at our same-store non-value-add communities to 95.4% as of today. Looking at rental rate trends
in the fourth quarter to date, new leases for our combined same-store portfolio have increased 7.1%, while renewed leases are up 8% for
a blended lease-over-lease rental rate increase of 7.7%. This lease-over-lease rent growth in Q4 2022 is in line with our guidance and is
on top of the 14.2% growth delivered in the fourth quarter of last year.
Our favorable loss to lease stood at 12% as of September 30, giving us continued pricing power in 2023. We continue to see good
retention throughout the portfolio, with a Q3 average resident retention rate of 57%. While our Q4 resident retention rate is 50%, it's still
a bit early, and we expect it to rise over the coming months as our residents make their renewal decisions. The rate at which residents
who are moving out to buy or rent a home is declining and stands at approximately 18% of move-outs for Q3 2022. This is down from
approximately 21% in Q2.
For the residents who are moving into our communities, we continue to see good demand and demographic statistics. New residents
over the last 90 days have had an average income of approximately $90,000 with 22% migrating into our markets from other states. We
continue to see in migration from the West Coast, Northeast and the Northern Illinois markets. I echo Scott's comments that we believe
we are well positioned for continued growth into 2023 with our earnings, loss to lease, and solid renter demand fundamentals in our
markets.
I would like to now turn the call over to Farrell to provide you with an update on our investment opportunities.
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Thanks, Ellis. I'd like to first provide an update on our long-standing value-add program. In the third quarter, we completed renovations
on 457 units. For these completed renovations, our renovation cost was $4,022 per unit, and these units achieved, on average, a $262
per unit increase in monthly rents over comparable unrenovated units. This yields an unlevered return on investment of 22.4%. And
year-to-date, we've completed 795 units and achieved a return on investment of 27.1%.
For the full year 2022, we now expect to renovate approximately 1,400 units, down from our previously guided target of 1,800 units. This
change is primarily due to a significantly higher retention rate on our unrenovated units at our value-add communities. Beginning in the
fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we will be including an additional 10 properties to our value-add program. These 10 properties are
comprised of 3,350 units, and we expect to achieve a return on investment these properties consistent with prior value-add projects. As
Scott mentioned earlier, for 2023, we now expect to renovate between 2,500 and 3,000 units.
We made the decision to delay some renovations at communities, mostly located in new markets where we do not yet have established
renovation teams on the ground. So starting these is not a question of if, but rather a question of when. Now on to our capital recycling
program, which is focused on building our presence in markets with strong fundamentals and exiting properties with less attractive
growth opportunities.
As of the quarter end, we had 2 properties, one in Louisville, Kentucky, the other in Terra Haute, Indiana, classified as held for sale, with
the sale of the Louisville property closing yesterday. These dispositions are expected to generate an aggregate sales price of
approximately $103 million and an expected blended cap rate of 4.7%. Regarding acquisitions, we expanded our presence in Charlotte,
North Carolina, by acquiring in August, a recently constructed 234-unit multifamily community, for $80 million.
In September, we acquired a 348-unit multifamily community in Tampa for $98 million. This community was built in 2012 and is an ideal
candidate for a value-add program in a top market position for long-term consistent growth.
Combined, these properties were purchased at a blended stabilized economic cap rate of 5.2%. And lastly, we entered into a joint
venture for the development of a 275-unit multifamily community to be built in Dallas, Texas. More specifically, the property is located in
Las Colinas, a master plan community with residential and retail space as well as 25 million square feet of office space, home to over 30
Fortune 500 companies. We expect this product to be completed in the third quarter of 2024 and have committed to invest an aggregate
$25.6 million into this joint venture, of which $9.3 million was funded last month. Currently, we have $100 million committed to 6
different projects, with $71.5 million funded to date. We expect the opportunity to purchase these communities as they complete
construction and stabilize between late 2023 and late 2024.
Before turning the call over to Jim, I'd like to provide some brief information on our expectations for new deliveries in our submarkets for
2023. Currently, CoStar has projected new unit deliveries in our submarkets based on our weighted average exposure at 2.2% of existing
inventory dropping to 1.8% in 2024. The vast majority of these new deliveries are Class A, which do not compete directly with our
well-located infill Class B communities. Asking rents at newly built communities, on average, have priced $521 per month higher than
our communities. Additionally, we do not solely evaluate the growth in supply for our markets, but we also consider growing demand.
Over the past several years, our submarkets have experienced robust demand for apartments, and that trend is expected to continue into
2023 and 2024. Currently, CoStar expected demand for apartments on markets to grow by 2.3% in 2023 and by another 2.4% in 2024.
I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim.
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Thanks, Farrell, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with our third quarter 2022 performance update, net income available to
common shareholders was $16.2 million as compared to $11.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, core FFO
grew to $64.3 million, up from $22.7 million a year ago, and core FFO per share grew 33% to $0.28 per share, up from $0.21 per share in
Q3 2021. This growth is a result of the earnings accretion associated with our merger with STAR as well as the sizable organic rent and
NOI growth we experienced throughout the combined portfolio this year. We started 2022 with 2 key goals. First, we sought to fully
integrate the operations of STAR and, second, secure the identified synergies and related accretion.
We're excited to remind you that we've accomplished both of these goals and are delivering 33% core FFO per share growth
year-over-year. IRT's third quarter combined same-store NOI growth was 11.5%, driven by revenue growth of 10.6%. This growth was
driven by a 13.3% increase in our average rental rates. While this NOI growth includes value add communities, we did see similar NOI
growth of 11.9% at our same-store non-value add communities, which reinforces the fundamental strength of our core markets. On the
property operating expense side, combined same-store operating expenses grew 9.1% in the third quarter, led by higher repairs and
maintenance and utility costs as well as higher real estate taxes and property insurance. The increase in repairs and maintenance, as
mentioned last quarter, was driven mainly by the timing of projects as well as inflationary pressure on both supplies and services for unit
terms. The increase in real estate taxes is primarily driven by some appeals we won in Q3 last year, causing our expense last year to be
lower than normal.
We continue to focus on managing expenses and inflationary pressure and are excited about some of the centralized initiatives we're
rolling out now that will save us approximately $2 million a year in future payroll costs. Now turning to our balance sheet. As of
September 30, our liquidity position was $326 million. We had approximately $24 million of unrestricted cash and $302 million available
on our line of credit.
At the end of September, we settled in 2 -- in full the 2 million shares that were previously sold on a forward basis under the ATM
program. The forward shares were settled at a weighted average sales price of $25 per share, and IRT received net proceeds of $50
million.
At quarter end, our net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.2x, down from 8.2x a year, and we continue to target a low 7 by the end of this year and
mid-6s by year-end 2023.The projects from the upcoming sale of our 2 held-for-sale assets will be used to repay outstanding
indebtedness and will increase our liquidity by approximately $50 million. As you think about managing the portfolio through a dynamic
macro environment in the near term, it is important to stress the strength of our capital structure.
In addition to a strong liquidity position, our debt refinancing that was completed in July enhanced our financial flexibility, with 90% of
our debt fixed under hedged and with 90% of our maturities in 2026 and beyond. Regarding our full year 2022 outlook, we are
maintaining our guidance for combined same-store NOI growth of 13.75% at the midpoint. We are raising our core FFO share growth
guidance by $0.005 to $1.075 (sic, see press release, "$1.07 to $1.08") at the midpoint. While we're slightly lowering our property revenue
growth guidance to 10.7% at the midpoint, we are also lowering our projections for operating expense growth to 5.5% from 6.3%, both
also at the midpoint. This better reflects our performance to date and greater clarity on expenses for the remainder of this year.
Looking ahead to 2023, we expect inflationary pressure to impact various expenses, including payroll, repairs and maintenance, and
contract services. We see lease-over-lease rent growth modeling, but given our strong rent growth in 2022, we have a 5% earning that
will contribute to 2023 revenue growth. Our operating focus will include the further implementation of automation and the realization of
efficiencies within our business. We'll provide full year 2023 guidance in February, but we can note that we expect 2023 to be another
year of growth for both NOI and core FFO per share.
Now I'll turn the call back to Scott. Scott?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Jim. As we enter the last 2 months of our calendar year and the anniversary of our merger with STAR, I'd like to reiterate the
confidence we have as a team in our expanded portfolio, which has undoubtedly strengthened over the past year as we seamlessly
integrated STAR and exceeded our initial expectation for annual synergies. I'm proud to say that we have successfully executed our
strategy under volatile market conditions and continue to invest in our business while delivering 33% core FFO per share growth on a
year-over-year basis in our most recent quarter. Going forward, we'll remain disciplined in our capital allocation efforts, which will be
focused on continued debt reduction and selective investments in our value-add and capital recycling programs.
We are also committed to driving shareholder value and returning capital to our shareholders. This was proven earlier this year when we
increased our quarterly dividend payout and put into place a share repurchase program. IRT is incredibly well-positioned to succeed in
the multifamily space due to the strength of our dedicated team and our 121 communities across resilient, high-growth markets. We
thank you for joining us today and look forward to seeing you at Nareit's REITWorld Growth Conference in San Francisco next month.
Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Can you walk through how demand looks currently? Are we at a normal sort of seasonal level? And then, on the concessions, are those
what you would consider to be a normal seasonal level as well?
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
On the demand side, as I mentioned in the call, I mean, what we're seeing from a high level is demand matching up with supply overall.
Obviously, every market is a little bit different. And we're seeing in some of our smaller markets, our Myrtle Beach and Wilmington,
Huntsville, maybe getting a little bit ahead on the supply side. But our larger markets like Dallas and Atlanta, and Denver, they're seeing
2% to 3% supply with significant population growth that should be able to more than meet the supply.
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I think, Brad, this is Jim. This is just time in there. I think it falls right there. I think with respect to Q4, I think certainly, the level of
normal pre-seasonality has returned to the business, but we still see good leasing demand for our units, given a lower exploration curve
in Q4. We do -- we certainly do kind of obviously track all those stats and look at it every period. The concessions that were offered were
offered in September and early part of October, and we're not offering concessions currently.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
And then, Jim, maybe sticking with you. The fourth quarter guide implies a pretty low OpEx figure. I know you mentioned that the third
quarter number was affected by the comps from the prior year. So is that improvement largely just comps? And then you gave a little
commentary on 2023 OpEx, but is there any sort of direction that you can give us -- or would you expect it to be higher than this year or
lower than this year?
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes, good question. I want to try to not answer the 2023 question. But I think for 2022, the big change is just real estate taxes. We
received some relatively high assessments. We pushed back pretty aggressively and are getting some good feedback and some good
results from those assessments with the tax assessors. And as a result, we've modified guidance for the year, given that new intelligence
around real estate taxes. So that's a real kind of big change. In terms of 2023, we certainly see the inflationary pressures continuing on
some of those key categories, repairs on manned utilities, et cetera, probably in the kind of the mid-single-digit growth ultimately for
next year, but I would say that's kind of in line with where we are this year. But as I mentioned, we're excited about all these efficiencies of
rolling out some of the centralizations of services that will even help us further kind of keep those inflationary pressures in check for next
year.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP
I just wanted one quick follow-up to Brad's question on concessions. Were those concentrated within the value-add pool or any specific
markets? Just any additional detail you could offer up?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
No, they weren't really -- they were -- well, yes, let me start over. They were concentrated in properties where we saw higher vacancy, and
they were upfront concessions in order to jump-start occupancy and get it back to where it has historically been, which we have
accomplished. And the important thing is that those concessions have now ended and have largely burned off. So from this point
forward, it's a full rent collection for the next 12 months.
 
Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP
And then, Scott, you kind of highlighted that economic uncertainty drove the decision to dial back the renovation goals for 2023. But is
the 2,500 to 3,000 units the right pace of redevelopment just for the current size of the portfolio? Or do you envision ramping to that
4,000 units if and when sort of the fog of uncertainty begins to lift?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I do anticipate ramping to the 4,000 once the uncertainty is behind us. And we just felt, Austin, that occupancy is -- it's obviously a
headline risk. I mean, you look at all the questions that we've received on occupancy, and the value-add clearly puts pressure on it. I
mean, if you think about it, every unit that turns when we start the value-add process within a community, every unit that turns, goes
vacant for 30 to 35 days. And that clearly has a downward pressure or puts a downward pressure on occupancy. So in the current
environment, we decided that we were going to dial it back a little bit. And all we did was we eliminated largely the markets where we
were beginning to value-add processing and didn't have any historical experience of work going on. So that way, we did not have to go
out and build teams to do the -- because remember, we do it all in-house, largely in-house. We didn't have to out and build value-add
teams in those markets, again, with the fog of uncertainty that you mentioned.
 
Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP
So you've talked historically about stabilized occupancy, I think, in the mid-95% range. How do we think about that value-add pool of
what the right level of occupancy is as sort of the size of that moves around and you look to manage occupancy for the overall portfolio?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Excluding the value add, we're at 95.5% today. We are 94.2%, Jim was it 94.2%?
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes, the average for the third quarter is 94.2%.
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
So it's about 120 basis points on the portfolio as a whole. But I think if you then look at the value add, it's about 92%. So it's about a 300
to 350 basis point reduction in occupancy because of the value add.
 
Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - VP
And from the elevated levels, you've achieved. So, can you remind us what the targeted returns are for redevelopment? And could we
potentially see those returns reaccelerate to where you were previously achieving, I think, 30% plus given the sort of concessions that
have been dialed back at this point?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
So historically, our target has been 20%, and we have exceeded that over the last 18 months, as you point out, by a significant amount.
We think it will normalize in that 20% range. And the reason -- the real reason that I believe that it got as high as it did was because we
saw obviously tremendous rent growth across the portfolio, including the value add, and we didn't -- had not yet experienced some of the
inflationary pressure on the expenses or on the costs. So now we have a little bit more cost, and some of the rent growth is moderating,
but we fully expect it to stay in that 20% range. And again, it's unlevered. So it's still very attractive returns.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Kerr;Citigroup Inc., Research Division;Equity Research Associate^ It's actually Nick Kerr on for Nick Joseph right now. And so, 2
quick ones for me. First, you touched on a little bit of the 5% earn-in. I was just wondering what the current loss to lease looks like as
well.
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Current loss to lease in the portfolio is 12%.
Nick Kerr;Citigroup Inc., Research Division;Equity Research Associate^ And then sort of on the renovation. So just wondering if those
returns do come in lower than expected. How easily can you guys pull back on that if, say, there's like an occupancy disruption or
something along those lines?
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Pretty easily. I mean, it's heavily managed. So as we did during COVID, we were able to pull back pretty significantly. I mean, we would
do the same if we see costs increase significantly or premiums drop.
Nick Kerr;Citigroup Inc., Research Division;Equity Research Associate^ And then, just one last quick one is, what are you seeing on cap
rates on dispositions and sort of where those are in the market today?
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Yes. I would say in the third quarter, we are seeing cap rates between 4% and 5%. There's not a lot of data points. There are transactions
but obviously substantially less than there have been in past quarters. It's a little bit trickier now with the run-up in the 10-year as people
don't really know what their debt costs are. So we'll have to see. But our capital recycling, we sold at a blended 5 -- 4.5 on the 2 deals,
and we're buying at a blended 5.2.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One.
 
Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
First one on the demand side, I guess, particularly the in-migration. You mentioned you continue to see strong inflows, which is great.
There's been some conversation or rhetoric about potentially a reversion of that in migration as companies kind of reinstitute return to
the office. I do not think that's going to happen. But can you maybe talk about that, I guess, in migration as a whole, if anecdotally or
from people on the ground in data or something you're seeing that there might be some -- a little bit of a reversion in migration or if it
continues to kind of chug ahead at a very impressive rate.
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
I'll let Ella talk about anecdotally if there's anything she's hearing about from our teams on the ground. But just looking at the data that
we're looking at, we don't see a slowdown in the Carolina markets, the Florida markets, to Dallas, Atlanta. I mean, everything we're
looking at showing that population and job is going to be pretty consistent and continue in those markets.
 
Ella Shaw Neyland
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - COO & Director
And to follow on on that also, pre-COVID, there was already a positive in-migration to our markets for all the reasons that people saw
jobs were being created, businesses were moving there. They tended to be business-friendly. A lot of our states have no state income tax.
So during COVID was an acceleration of that as people moved into those markets and basically worked, played and taught, and
exercised from home. That will probably moderate, but we'll still continue to see, and we still continue to see people moving in from
other markets to find a quality of life and also to find a good job opportunity.
 
Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Other one is on leasing trends. So 2 things. First, what are you sending out for renewals in November, December, and January? And the
second part is now that you've kind of got an occupancy backup and there's less exposure, concessions are gone. What are you getting on
or asking for new leases? And do we actually see a slight uptick to close out the fourth quarter with those sort of short-term pressures
alleviated?
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean, good question, Neil. I think we're seeing, kind of, generally speaking, a similar rent growth trend in terms of what we're
sending out for renewals and new leases as what we've already previously disclosed for the fourth quarter. There might be now that
occupancy is back to that kind of mid-95% level, we'll probably see a slightly kind of uptick in that, but it will be on the margin in terms of
overall changing the ultimate kind of lease-over-lease effective rent growth for the quarter.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Can you comment more on the discrepancy and occupancy between value-add and your overall portfolio? When you look at the prior
quarter differences like 20 basis points on fund?

Yes. I mean, I think what Scott said, normally, we look to see from the management of occupancy, we manage occupancy in that kind of
mid-95% range, value add does have an initial kind of impact to it. So in response to Austin's question earlier, kind of how we think about
occupancy at the value of that portfolio is typically averaging about that 92% range. But...
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
No. I think the important factor is that it's when you start the value-add process at a community, every unit deterrence becomes vacant.
And since we started 8 new projects, every unit deterred at those communities was vacant for the better part of the month or a little bit
beyond. Whereas a couple of years ago or last year, most of the value-add work was being done at communities that were in the program
for a number of years. So there were less and less units turning and being vacant for the value-add process because we had already done
a lot of them. Hope that makes sense.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Yes, it does. I was wondering if it was taking longer to turn the units over, just supply chain issues related to those issues...
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
If it is, it's not by much.
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
To Scott's point, it's more the volume now.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
When you talked also about reducing the renovation program for next year due to higher retention. But I was wondering if there was a
reluctance from renters to pay significantly higher rent today than maybe a year ago.
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
We're not seeing any pushback from renters.
 
Ella Shaw Neyland
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - COO & Director
Especially on the value-add because we're delivering a quality home. We're in essence delivering an apartment home that looks like an A,
but priced at a B be. So it's a lot of demand for them.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
On the acquisitions you discussed, you discussed the cap rates, those closed August, September. Since then rates moved up, I think, 60
basis points or more. Can you just comment on where pricing would be today on those assets and how deep the competitive bidding
process was?
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Yes. I mean, so for high-quality assets in good markets, there's still a pool of buyers. There's definitely not as many. I mean, I would say
that cap rates trail the treasury, so I would imagine that there would be some increase in cap rates. There just haven't been any real data
points or closings in the past 2 weeks as the 10 years runoff. It's pretty challenging because now it's dropped back down to 4. So again,
it's -- what we're seeing in this market is buyers just don't know what their debt costs are going to be. So it's challenging to commit to
any price when you don't know what your overall returns are going to be. So that's what's limiting the amount of buyers -- but there's still
some opportunities out there. There are people that if we didn't buy in the second half of last year, there's still a lot of profit to be taken.
So we do see people testing the market. It's just unclear right now where cap rates are going to settle out in this quarter with the run-up
in the treasuries.

Just one final question. In a couple of weeks, there's going to be a November vote on the ballot Orange County, the rent in control
ordinances on it. I'm just wondering how involved you are in the Friday against this proposal? And any other commentary you could
have?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
So fortunately, we have only one asset in that county. A group of landlords got together and did challenge that ballot initiative. And the
judge that's there ruled to allow it to go forward on the ballot, but also ruled that it's contrary to existing law and basically told the
landlords that if it's approved, you'll have your opportunity to fight it in court because it is contrary to existing law in that state. So it
remains to be seen. I think you can look at this ballot initiative throughout time, and it really is a failed initiative. So if it passes, it will be
fought. And again, fortunately, we only have one asset. So we're just watching it closely.

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
I think you mentioned that the average income for new residents is $90,000, which seems like the top-quartile income. So curious about
where that has been in the past and where you think that metric could go in the future.
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean, good question. That is a statistic for all the new -- just for the new residents that have moved into our communities over the
last 90 days. That statistic has been generally rising slightly. Historically, maybe a year ago, it was $78,000, I think, was the number. And
before that, maybe early part of 2020, it was $72,000. So it's been steadily rising as, I guess, wages have been rising as well.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
And maybe one more on supply. I think you talked about kind of the broader supply metrics and the demand metrics in your markets. Are
there any markets where you think supply could actually be a challenge? And also, are there any markets where you think the ply risk is
overstated?
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
So again, our smaller markets, your Huntsville, your Wilmingtons, your Myrtle Beaches, are having elevated supply, and we are seeing
that. I think it's short-lived. I mean, I think by 2024, we'll be through that. Some larger markets that have some supply concerns are
Nashville and Houston. But again, the amount of people moving to those markets should absorb that, but they are elevated in those
markets. Our larger markets are Atlanta, I guess Atlanta, Dallas, and Denver are really only seeing 2% to 3% supply growth, which is
pretty healthy.

Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
What's your sense of real estate taxes next year? I know increases are appealed and volatile, but any view of how we should think about
this headed into 2023?
 
James J. Sebra
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I mean, again, we'll give formal guidance in February 2023. But some of the initial indications is that real estate tax growth for next
year is going to be in that kind of mid-single-digit range again, 4%, 5%, 6%. There was some talk earlier this year where we were seeing
some of the high reassessments coming in from the tax assessors that, given the movement in the market that you could actually see
maybe a negative tax growth next year. I don't think that's likely, but we're thinking it is kind of in that mid-single digits right now.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
And then, in terms of the 2,500 to 3,000 communities you're renovating in 2023, what's the process of getting a renovation team in
place?
 
Farrell M. Ender
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Well, we have them in place. That's the beauty. I mean, these are markets like Atlanta, Tampa that we have teams built out in place. So
it's just a matter of growing those teams slightly to absorb the additional properties that we're adding to the value-add portfolio.

The final question comes from Mason Guell with Baird.
 
Mason P. Guell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Research Analyst
How are you looking to optimize revenue going forward? Are you looking more to push occupancy during a seasonally softer period really
focused on pushing rates by capturing your loss to lease?
 
Scott F. Schaeffer
Independence Realty Trust, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
We're always looking to balance the occupancy with the rent growth. And we have a revenue management system and team in place that
is constantly looking at available units in the market versus competitor pricing and our pricing and just making sure that we balance the
2 while still capturing the rent growth that's available. As we look back into the third quarter, we kind of saw the volatility, and we saw
the tail-off coming in the fourth quarter, and we pushed rents a little bit harder through the end of the third quarter in order to capture as
much as we could and to build that earning into 2023 and to put a little bit of pressure on occupancy. But as we've indicated, we were
able to quickly rectify that. And we're now again at a very stabilized 95.5% occupancy in the non-value-add communities. And that's our
goal is to stay in that 95% to 96% range while capturing as much revenue growth as the market will allow.

Thank you all for joining us today. I want you all to have a good rest of the week. Jim wants me to say, "Go Philly's", because, obviously,
we're here in Philadelphia, and we're very excited about our baseball team. But again, thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you again
next quarter.
