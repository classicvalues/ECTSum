PRESENTATION
 
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Industrial Logistics Properties Trust Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions). Please note, this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Barry, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Kevin Barry
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - Director of IR
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call are ILPT's President and Chief Operating Officer, Yael
Duffy; and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Brian Donley. In just a moment, they will provide details about our business and our
performance for the third quarter of 2022, followed by a question-and-answer session with sell-side analysts.
First, I would like to note that the recording and retransmission of today's conference call is prohibited without the prior written consent
of the company. Also note that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on ILPT's beliefs and expectations
as of today, Wednesday, October 26, 2022, and actual results may differ materially from those that we project. The company undertakes
no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to the forward-looking statements made in today's conference call.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause those differences is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, which can be accessed from our website, ilptreit.com or the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned not to place
undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP numbers during this call, including
normalized funds from operations or normalized FFO, adjusted EBITDA and cash-based net operating income or cash basis NOI. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP figures to net income and the components to calculate cash available for distribution are available in
our supplemental operating and financial data package, which also can be found on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over
to Yael.
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Before we start, I would like to welcome Brian Donley, who joined ILPT as our Chief Financial
Officer and Treasurer on October 1. On today's call, I will provide a summary of our financing and deleveraging plans and review our third
quarter operating and leasing performance. Brian will then provide details on our financial results and balance sheet before we open the
call to questions. In September, we closed on a $1.2 billion debt package that enabled us to fully repay the bridge loan facility used for
the Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation acquisition. While the pricing on this debt is wider than the pricing of the bridge loan,
interest rates and market spreads have continued to rise.
Additionally, we are pleased -- accordingly, we are pleased with the outcome of this transaction in the debt markets. Importantly, this
refinancing extended our weighted average debt maturity to over 4 years and provides us time and flexibility to execute on our
deleveraging plans. As we have discussed on prior calls, our plan may include relaunching the marketing campaign of the 30 properties
previously identified for dispositions, resuming discussions with potential partners for an equity interest in ILPT's Mountain Industrial
joint venture or exploring additional joint venture opportunities with properties where fixed debt is already in place. As we work through
these strategies, we will use available proceeds to pay down debt and improve leverage.
Now turning to portfolio fundamentals and operating results. As of September 30, 2022, ILPT's consolidated portfolio included 413
warehouse and distribution properties in 39 states, totaling approximately 60 million square feet with a weighted average remaining
lease term of approximately 9 years. Occupancy at quarter end reached 99.2%, up 30 basis points on a sequential quarter basis. As we
are in a time of economic uncertainty, we are encouraged that 78% of our revenues come from investment grade tenants or subsidiaries
or from our secure Hawaii land leases.
During the third quarter, we entered new and renewal leases for approximately 1.7 million square feet at weighted average rental rates
that were nearly 77.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space, reflecting record quarterly leasing spreads. The impact of this
activity is an increase of $4.8 million in annualized rental revenue, which showcases our ability to generate organic cash flow growth
while maintaining portfolio stability. We executed 5 new leases totaling approximately 543,000 square feet for a weighted average lease
term of 7.4 years. Included in this activity was a 5-year lease for a 368,000 square foot warehouse and distribution building in Ohio that
we acquired vacant as part of the Monmouth acquisition. In under 6 months, we are able to leverage industry and broker relationships to
lease this building to an investment grade-rated tenant with minimal concessions. We signed 4 new deals in Hawaii totaling 175,000
square feet at a blended roll-up in rent of 62%.
As Brian will discuss later in the call, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $1.2 million this quarter related to one tenant, which leaves 3
parcels within our Damon portfolio in Hawaii. Almost immediately, we were able to execute new leases with replacement tenants at
average roll up in rent of 68%. These results continue to highlight the scarcity of land, persistent demand and value of our Hawaii real
estate. Renewal activity was also strong with 9 executed leases for approximately 1.1 million square feet, primarily on the Mainland at an
average roll up in rent of 26.1% with a weighted average lease term of 3.7 years.
As asking rents continue to increase, we are selectively completing short-term renewals with certain tenants to take advantage of market
conditions. For example, we signed 760,000 square feet -- as scheduled to roll by the end of 2025, mainly driven by our Mainland
properties. Given the strength of the industrial sector, we feel confident that our active leasing pipeline will position us to maximize
mark-to-market rent growth and increase cash flows. Our pipeline includes 36 deals for 3.6 million square feet, of which roughly 1.4
million square feet is in advanced stages of negotiation or lease documentation. Once executed, we expect these leases will yield average
roll up in rent of 20% on the mainland and 40% in Hawaii, further illustrating the strength of our portfolio. I will now turn the call over to
Brian to review our financial results.
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Thank you, Yael, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our consolidated financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Normalized
funds from operations were $14.9 million or $0.23 per share, a decline of $15.4 million compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted
EBITDAre increased approximately 85% year-over-year at $76.1 million, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Monmouth. The major
drivers impacting normalized FFO over the prior year quarter was higher interest expense, partially offset by a $38 million increase in
NOI, primarily from the Mamba portfolio.
Total portfolio same-property cash basis NOI for the third quarter decreased 1.9% year-over-year. This includes a negative impact of $1.2
million of bad debt reserves related to the Hawaii leases that Yael mentioned earlier. Excluding these charges, consolidated
same-property cash basis NOI increased 1.2% primarily due to our leasing activity and contractual rent steps. Interest expense increased
$80.7 million over the prior year quarter, including a $45.6 million increase in cash interest expense and a $35.5 million of noncash
amortization of financing fees, of which $31.4 million was related to the bridge loan facility that we paid off at the end of the quarter.
G&A expense increased $4.4 million over the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of our larger scale following the Monmouth
acquisition. Turning to our balance sheet and financing activities. In September, we successfully closed on a $1.2 billion mortgage
financing and used the loan proceeds and cash on hand to pay off borrowings under our $1.4 billion bridge loan facility. The new
financing is secured by a portfolio of 104 industrial properties totaling 18.6 million square feet across 31 states and is comprised of a $1.1
billion mortgage and $135 million mezzanine loan. The loans are interest-only 5-year floating rate loans with 2-year initial terms and 3
1-year extension options and carry a total weighted average interest rate of SOFR plus 393 basis points per annum.
We also entered into an interest rate cap limiting sulfur to 2.25% through October 2024, effectively fixing the interest rate on the entire
CMBS loan at 6.18%. This new financing extends our weighted average debt maturity to 4.4 years and allows for a portion of the
borrowings to be prepaid without penalty. Including extension options, ILPT now has no debt maturities until 2027. As part of the loan
agreements, we have maintained flexibility to repay debt as we further execute on our deleveraging priorities. Assuming short-term
interest rates continue to rise and our caps remain in the money, our current quarterly cash interest expense run rate is approximately
$59 million.
Non-cash amortization of financing costs is projected to be approximately $6.7 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to investing
activities. As previously disclosed, our consolidated joint venture acquired 1 of 2 properties that were under agreement by Monmouth for
$38 million during the quarter. The JV terminated the contract for the second committee property, given the market volatility seen over
the last few months. We spent $8.5 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter, including $5 million for development costs,
$2.2 million of tenant improvements and leasing costs and $1.3 million of building improvements.
Regarding the common dividend, we expect to maintain the current quarterly distribution rate of $0.01 per share to preserve liquidity
and allow for short-term flexibility until we improve ILPT's leverage profile. Our financing plans are subject to market conditions and the
time line to accomplish our goals is currently uncertain. We believe ILPT continues to own a strong real estate portfolio with an
exceptional tenant roster and dependable cash flows. We look forward to providing updates on our progress in the future. That
concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the lines for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Bryan Maher of B. Riley Securities.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
A couple of questions. Maybe just start with the dividend. Yael and Brian, at what leverage level once you start to delevering through
asset sales or JVs? Do you think the Board would start to contemplate reinstating at least some compelling dividend?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Bryan, good question. It's something at the front of everybody's minds here, where resets only paying a 10. I think our deleveraging plans,
there's a lot of moving pieces and different fermentations that could happen. But we need to turn -- get interest down a few turns with
debt-to-EBITDA of over 13x right now. And until we're in the single digits, I don't think it's a real conversation. So we'll keep reviewing the
board will keep reevaluating every quarter, and we'll see where we're at. But it's not going to happen until late 2023 at the earliest.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. And then maybe to that point, given what you're seeing in the marketplace and given your discussions with the JV partners that
were potentially going to onboard to the Monmouth assets and the sales process, I think it was like on 30 properties. I mean what would
be your best guess that you think -- what quarter half year do you think you might be able to legitimately reengage with those entities to
start to prune off assets? Or is it just too soon to tell?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Bryan, I think it's too soon to tell. I think we've been in discussions with brokers, with some of our other industrial peers. And I think
everyone is just waiting for things to normalize. And I know that's a subjective answer, but -- there's been 40% less transaction volume
from Q2 to Q3. I think buyers and sellers -- buyers don't want to buy before they feel that the bottom has been reached and sellers who
aren't distressed aren't willing to be distressed sellers. So I think the next couple of quarters, I think we'll see what the new normal is.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. And just two more quick ones. Are you guys seeing any rent pushback on those increases that you're implementing?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
None.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. And then lastly, maybe for Brian. The OpEx, I think it was $8.4 million, $8.5 million, somewhere in there. Is that a good run rate for
now until we see either asset sales or the deconsolidation of the JVs.
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. That's a pretty good proxy this quarter. There's some seasonality type OpEx numbers in there, and we do recover a large percentage
of the operating costs that run through our P&L. So make sure you factor that in for modeling purposes.
 
Operator
The next question is from Mitchell Germain of JMP Securities.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
The Hawaii backfill potentially credit upgrade there? Is there any sort of color you can give us?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Yes. So as I mentioned, it was 1 tenant who leased 3 parcels. They actually had a natural lease expiration of October of 2022. And so they
had wanted to -- again, they are a local player. They wanted to renew 1 of the 3 parcels and we chose -- we felt there was opportunity to
release to better credit tenants, which we actually were able to accomplish, both we -- of the 3 parcels, 1 tenant, at least 1 and another
tenant at least 2, and all -- both of them were invested investment grade.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Great. Is there a timing differential we should be aware of?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
No, the new leases will go into effect on November 1.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Great. Appreciate it. Brian mentioned some flexibility on the mortgage, the new financing. And I'm curious, you could pay down -- like
can you pay down the mezz? Is that kind of what you're talking about? Or can you pay down the principal of the entire -- what -- maybe
just provide some perspective on how that can work going forward.
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. What was negotiated is that we could repay 20% of both loans as part of that deal. So that's roughly $250 million without penalty.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
With no penalty?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Correct.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Great. And you guys had mentioned some color around some of the flexibility you have with regards to deleveraging. Are we just talking
about the Mainland? Or can you -- will you possibly look to capitalize on some of the Hawaii properties?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Yes. So we have fixed debt in place on both the Mainland and in Hawaii. So I think we can be selective if we decide to go down presenting
additional joint venture opportunities either or.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Got you. That's helpful. And then last one for me, Brian. I just want to make sure I understand the kind of one-timers this quarter. You've
got the $1.2 million that gets adjusted out. There's some OpEx noise. And then you gave us a run rate of around $66 or so million gap for
interest for next quarter. Is that the way to think about it?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
That's correct. This quarter had the rest of the noise for the bridge loan facility, which would adjust out of FFO.
 
Operator
The next question is from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
Maybe sticking with the bad debt. I understand the $1.2 million, but obviously, if we compare to 2Q, it's down kind of a $4 million on a
rental revenue basis. Is that just GAAP adjustments? Is the $1.2 million just the cash bad debt? Or is there something else that was
dragging down that rental revenue this quarter?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Yes, it's a great question. The Q2 actually had a one-timer to the positive. It was $3.5 million of below-market lease value that was
written off related to a tenant that was turning over -- so Q2 was artificially inflated and then you had the bad debt in Q3 of the $1.2
million. So you sort of net those 2 items out, and that's a better run rate.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
Got it. I appreciate that, Brian. And then I assume the backfill, you mentioned the blended 68% for those 3 spaces in Hawaii. I assume
that was in October, so that didn't hit 3Q numbers. Is that a fair assumption?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Yes, that's exactly right.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
Okay. Then you've kind of laid the scenario, I appreciate your commentary around potentially bringing 30 assets back to market, looking
at additional JVs and maybe looking to do more JVs in the fixed rate assets, but not rushing into anything because of what's going on in
the market. But it seems like a basic question, but how long can you wait? Is there a point in time where you say we need to continue --
begin to transact just to bring this leverage down?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
I think we have time to be patient. I mean we all know that the bridge was looming over us with a maturity of February 2023. So the fact
that we were able to refinance out of the bridge, I think, again, provides us time to be patient. So I don't think we're going to prematurely
do something that is in the best interest...
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
All right. And then maybe, Brian, how is the debt cross-collateralized -- and does that kind of limit what is available to sell out right now?
Or do you have some flexibility there?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
We have some flexibility. I mean, there are certain parts of the portfolio that have mortgages, and we'd have to look at what we could get
for that in total proceeds. But each loan tranche of the overall CMBS, as we outlined, is inclusive of 105 assets. And the Mountain JV
floating rate debt has its own portfolio, but there are options around that, that we can look to, to pull different levers to raise capital.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
So maybe to say it another way, the 30 assets that you had first brought to market and then pulled before you did the refinancing, does
the refinance that you reduce that pool of 30 assets? Or could -- are those still available to go out to market?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Yes, those are still available to go to market. That's right.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
Got it. And then kind of last one for me. Kind of thinking bigger picture strategically with the relationship with the RMR Group. In a
normal operating environment, the discussion around one of the benefits of RMR is the resources, the scale, you've talked often about
the large funnel when it comes to seeing more acquisitions and being able to underwrite more when it gets to a situation like this where
it's all hands on deck and trying to delever and trying to really manage through a challenging market and situation what is the
interaction with the RMR Group? And kind of is there a benefit that, that scale brings in this type of environment, not just a normal
operating environment?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Yes. I mean I think even more so in today's environment, I mean, we're in a time of economic uncertainty, I think asset management,
property management, accounting, I mean it's all hands on deck.
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I would add to the CMBS financing was a correlation. Our banking relationships and the ability to execute on such a large
transaction was a huge benefit having MR behind us.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
So you do think when kind of the capital markets or the investment sales market to open back up, you'll be able to move swiftly on that
front just to delever because of that? Is that the benefit of that relationship as well?
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Absolutely.
 
Operator
The next question is from Aditi Balachandran of RBC Capital Markets.
 
Aditi Balachandran
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Associate
Just a really quick question for me. Just can you remind us what is the $100 million of restricted cash pertaining to?
 
Brian E. Donley
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - CFO & Treasurer
$100 million is at the Mountain joint venture level, and that includes operating cash as well as loan reserves at the JV level.
 
Operator
There are no other questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over
to Yael Duffy for closing remarks.
 
Yael Duffy
Industrial Logistics Properties Trust - President & COO
Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at NAREIT in the coming weeks.
