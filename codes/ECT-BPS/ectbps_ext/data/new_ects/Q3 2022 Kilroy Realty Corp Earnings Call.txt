Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's Q3 2022 Kilroy Realty Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Dante,
and I'll be the moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Hutcheson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Capital
Markets. Sir, the floor is yours.
 
William E. Hutcheson
Kilroy Realty Corporation - SVP of IR & Capital Markets
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are John Kilroy, Chairman and CEO; Tyler Rose,
our President; Rob Paratte, EVP of Leasing and Business Development; and Eliott Trencher, our CIO and Interim CFO.
At the outset, I need to say that some of the information we will be discussing during this call is forward-looking in nature. Please refer to
our supplemental package for a statement regarding the forward-looking information on this call and in the supplemental. This call is
being telecast live on our website and will be available for replay for the next 8 days, both by phone and over the Internet.
Our earnings release and supplemental package have been filed on the Form 8-K with SEC and both are also available on our website.
John will start the call with third quarter highlights, and Eliott will discuss our financial results and provide you with updated 2022
earnings guidance. Then we will be happy to take your questions. John?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Bill. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with some big picture comments and then review recent
highlights. Over the course of the past several months, the economy has increasingly become uncertain, while at the same time, showing
some encouraging data points.
Labor markets remain strong, supply chain constraints are easing and the consumer continues to spend. However, the unprecedented
pace at which central banks are raising interest rates to tame inflation is by many accounts increasing the likelihood of a hard landing
resulting in increased volatility in the public markets and limited transaction activity in the private markets.
While we do not control the Fed and over certain ramifications its actions will have on the real estate market, we are laser focused on the
items we can control. Just as we position KRC to play offense coming out of the 2008, 2009 recession, we believe we are similarly well
positioned this time around.
Our leverage is low, we have no debt maturities until the end of 2024 and over $1.6 billion of liquidity, including a fully untapped credit
facility. While no one wants a recession, Kilroy is cycle tested and prepared. During the third quarter, the push to return to the office
intensified as many companies implemented stricter policies to encourage in-person work and collaboration.
These efforts have been led by financial services and professional service firms, but we are seeing increasingly technology and media
companies follow suit. A lot of large cap companies and their smaller brethren are requiring employees to be back in the office 2 or 3
days a week, which has generated tangible progress in both our physical occupancy and Kastle data which recently hit a post-pandemic
high.
This has also driven steady improvement throughout the year in our parking income. Like many, we believe that softness in the labor
market will likely strengthen employers resolve around encouraging work from the office and will also resolve in employees adhering to
those plans more closely.
The bifurcation between high-quality space and commodity space continues to grow, which bodes well for our young and modern
portfolio. According to JLL, in the third quarter, 90% of the space added to the sublease market was in older and less desirable buildings.
Furthermore, throughout 2022, nearly 50% of markets nationally set records for high watermark rents on Premier Class A properties.
This includes several of our markets, such as San Diego, Austin, San Francisco. Companies that are making decisions today understand
the importance of locating in modern amenitized buildings, and we're seeing that.
Turning to recent highlights. We signed 390,000 square feet of leases since the end of the second quarter with an average term of 8
years and average rent roll-ups of plus 7% on a cash basis and plus 27% on a GAAP basis. Some highlights include a 63,000 square foot
renewal of financial services tenant in Menlo Park, 55,000 square feet of renewals and expansions from 2 apparel companies in Culver
City and 11-year 28,000 square foot new lease with Boston Consulting Group at 2100 Kettner in Little Italy, a 10-year 70,000 square foot
renewal with a scientific research and development company in Del Mar, a 7.5-year 35,000 square foot renewal in San Francisco signed
late yesterday afternoon with a major broadcasting company.
In a 15-year 51,000 square foot lease with Page, a national full-service design firm at Indeed Tower, bringing this project to 68% leased.
As we previously signaled, demand in Indeed Towers increased over the last couple of quarters and we expect to have more good news to
discuss in the coming months.
Life Science demand, especially in top-tier markets, has been holding up well. Vacancy is roughly 2% in South San Francisco and roughly
2% in the Del Mar Heights and UTC region, our 2 biggest clusters. We have multiple prospects interested in Kilroy Oyster Point Phase 2,
which consists of 3 buildings and 875,000 square feet. Our 1,000 luxury residential units continue to perform well. Occupancy is
approximately 94% and rents increasing meaningfully compared to last year.
Additionally, Los Angeles is removing the eviction moratorium effective early next year, which is another encouraging sign of policy
moving in the right direction. On the capital markets side, we closed the sale of 3130 Wilshire, a 46-year-old building in West L.A. for $48
million in gross proceeds or roughly $500 per square foot. This property no longer fit our strategy given its age and future capital
requirements.
Bigger picture, the sales market was quiet during the third quarter, asset level debt is hard to secure, especially for non-trophy assets
and capital, while plentiful is generally on the sidelines. We are pleased to close the sale of 3130 Wilshire. As we alluded to last quarter,
we think it is prudent to let the capital markets stabilize before selling additional properties.
On the investment side, we are staying patient, waiting to see how market conditions evolve and whether motivated sellers come to
market. While we expect there will be acquisition opportunities at some point, we are not there yet.
Our operating premise over the past 25 years as a public company is that there are times to buy, times to sell, times to develop and times
like now to be patient. To that end, we said on our second quarter call that we were delaying the start of Santa Fe Summit, a 600,000
square foot plus life science development in San Diego.
Similarly, we intend to hold off on the construction of Stadium Tower, our Austin development site until the economy gives us more
confidence or we pre-lease a substantial portion of the project. As a reminder, the Stadium Tower site is fully designed and permit ready
for a roughly 500,000 square foot building.
Since we acquired the project earlier this year, we have done preconstruction work, which reduces the lead time to deliver a completed
building. Additionally, we have the right to add density now given our proximity to the light rail, which we plan to study in more detail
over the coming months.
As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, in 2009, we positioned the company so that we could play offense as the economy improved, which
resulted in some well-timed acquisitions and development starts in the Bay Area, Seattle and Hollywood. We are doing the same today
by curbing spend, bolstering liquidity and getting our top-notch development sites shovel ready so that we can be an early mover when
the time is appropriate.
In summary, our strategy can be summarized via 3 tenets: best-in-class real estate, disciplined capital allocation and fortress balance
sheet. This recipe is cycle-tested, having guided us through up and down markets over the past, and we are confident that the adhering
to these principles positions us to be opportunistic as circumstances warrant.
Lastly, we want to remind you of our upcoming investor event in South San Francisco to be held on Monday, November 14, right before
NAREIT. We are eager to show everyone Kilroy Oyster Point and has some interesting speakers lined up to talk about the project, the
overall market and the company. If you need more details, please reach out, and we hope to see you all there. That completes my
remarks.
Now I'll turn the call over to Eliott.
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
Thank you, John. FFO was $1.17 per share in the third quarter, similar to the second quarter. On a same-store basis, third quarter cash
NOI was up roughly 6%. The growth was driven by free rent burn-off for some office leases, improved parking revenue and higher
occupancy at One Paseo residential. GAAP same-store NOI was up approximately 2%.
At the end of the quarter, our stabilized portfolio was 91% occupied and 93% leased. Included in this number are 3 development and
redevelopment properties, which were brought into service during the quarter. These 3 projects were 59% occupied and leased as of
quarter end.
Turning to the balance sheet. We enhanced our liquidity post quarter end by a $400 million unsecured term loan at a rate of adjusted
SOFR plus 95 basis points. We have $200 million of the $400 million outstanding, which is subject to an interest rate cap and can draw
down the balance at any point over the next 11 months. We believe this is an efficient source of capital, and it gives us enhanced liquidity
to fund our development pipeline while continuing to provide predictability to our interest expense. Net debt to third quarter annualized
EBITDA remained about 6x, and we have no debt maturities until December of 2024.
Now let's discuss our updated 2022 guidance. To begin, let me remind you that we approach our near-term performance forecasting
with a high degree of caution given all the uncertainties in today's economy. Our current guidance reflect information and market
intelligence as we know it today. The COVID-related impact to significant shifts in the economy or markets, tenant demand, construction
costs or new supply going forward could have a meaningful impact on our results in ways not currently reflected in our analysis.
Projected revenue recognition dates are subject to several factors that we can't control, including the timing of tenant occupancies. With
those caveats, our updated assumptions for 2022 are as follows: As always, no acquisitions are forecasted. And as John referenced, we
do not anticipate any additional sales for the balance of this year.
Our new term loan has $200 million outstanding as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. We do not expect to draw any more in 2022.
Development spending for the balance of the year is expected to be $100 million to $150 million, which translates to roughly $400
million of spend for the full year. This is a meaningful decrease from the roughly $600 million of development spend we were projecting
earlier in the year.
As we discussed last quarter, we expect the year-end occupancy to be at the low end of our range or approximately 91% of its portfolio
and residential occupancy is projected to stay around the current level in the mid-90% range.
Same-store cash NOI growth is now expected to be between 6% and 6.5%, a 75-basis-point increase from our prior estimate. The
increase is due to strong results to date, specifically around parking revenue and the residential properties.
Putting this all together, our updated 2022 FFO guidance is projected to range between $4.62 and $4.68 per share with a midpoint of
$4.65 per share, which is a $0.07 increase compared to our prior guidance.
The increase is due to the solid third quarter results and the adjustment disposition expectation. The new range implies a $0.02 decline
for the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter, which is predominantly due to the term loan that closed in the beginning of
October. That completes my remarks. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Dante?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
John, I was just wondering if you could provide a little color on the South San Francisco Life Science demand. We've been out there
several times. And it seems like demand has slowed down out there. And I'm just curious what you're seeing both broker deals and
maybe non-broker deals for KOP 2?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Yes, sure. Rob, do you want to take that one?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Sure, Steve. What I would say is that for -- again, let's talk about KOP compared to other projects that are out there. We have scale. We
have 3 buildings. We can grow companies, which is what a lot of the larger companies are seeking, which is the ability to establish a
toehold and grow. No doubt, as we've talked about before, early-stage companies are a little bit on hold because their boards are putting
them under more scrutiny and telling them to slow down taking space while they sort through this uncertain environment we're in.
I don't want to get into a lot of detail on our discussions, but we are, as John mentioned in his comments, having discussions with several
firms and we're pleased with the activity we have, and I would call it steady in terms of the inquiries we've had, the tours we've had, and
we are having some fairly in-depth conversations with companies.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And then, John, maybe just on the broader leasing and maybe specifically what you're seeing in downtown San Francisco, I know
you've had some either tenant move-outs or some sublease space coming back on the market like Nektar Therapeutics. And I'm just
wondering what you're hearing from kind of the business leaders about leasing, specifically in downtown San Francisco for either
vacancy or maybe pending upcoming availabilities?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Let me deal with the big picture for a second. Then I'm going to turn it over to Rob and address some of the specifics that you raised,
Steve. I mentioned on the last number of calls that in a period of volatility and uncertainty, it's natural, whether it's people or whether it's
companies. If you don't need to make a decision, you don't make a decision. If you can delay a decision, you delay a decision -- that's just
smart. And that continues to be in all of our markets, although we're beginning to see a lot more activity. Specific to San Francisco, Rob,
can you address that?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Sure, Steve. Again, I think it's really important to emphasize the difference between properties, right? There's Class A premium
properties, which I think our portfolio falls into. If you've got a young portfolio, young buildings, well-located modern improvements,
amenities, you're going to have activity, and that's borne out in the data in San Francisco.
The top 20 buildings in San Francisco, according to JLL right now, have seen effective rent gains of 15% since 2019, and in some cases,
increases beyond that. So again, if you've got property that tenants want, they're going to be very selective and they're going to absorb it.
And a really good example of that is Google taking almost 300,000 feet in Q3.
A lot of rumors float around the techs on the sideline, but I think that is not the case as we've seen in other markets we have as well.
Sublease space has remained at about 7.2 million square feet. It fluctuates up and down, but we've been holding in that range for quite a
few quarters.
And again, it really depends on the quality of the space. The Google lease I mentioned is actually a sublease, and that's a high-quality
building that they took. So there are the haves and the have-nots. And I think the last thing I'd say, if you compare the REIT industry to
the private markets in terms of ownership, some of the private owners are going to have, I think, struggle as debt markets continue to
tighten and lending becomes more difficult.
So there's going to be difficult in fulfilling capital requirements for leases and operating the building in a Class A manner. So Kilroy
positions itself as a true partner with our tenants. And what we're really doing, as John mentioned, we got a lease signed later in the
evening last night, and that was a true partnership with the tenant working hand in glove with them to get their management on board
with the lease as well as making the numbers work for Kilroy.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. I guess maybe just as a follow-up, John. Just big picture, given the discussions you've had with the mayor, I mean do you feel like
the city has made enough progress, both in crime, homelessness and attractiveness to bring people back that makes the city sort of
viable going forward?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Well, I'm going to start with the premise that no, they have not made as much -- enough progress. I mean that requires a lot more. But
it's that old thing, if the train is going south, you got to stop it before you have a chance to turn it around and go north. They think we're
going north now. But we've got a lot to do, and we have an election coming up to reelect the mayor-appointed district attorney, Jenkins.
She's running for election now.
That's an important race. There's a couple of supervisor races that are important. And I'll say this about San Francisco, I'm not in New
York, as you know, but in terms of ownership, whether it's New York, San Francisco, L.A., Seattle, wherever, leadership and policy makes
a difference. I've been -- as you all know, everybody on this call, you've heard me speak for 10 years saying my biggest concern in the
world has been politicians and some of them are not in our country.
But the fact is we need good policy. We've seen some real good changes in San Francisco and elsewhere. The selections that are coming
up that affect the state, affect the country, affect the various individual cities that we're in are all important. Some we're going to win on.
Some we're probably going to lose on, I don't know.
But directionally, I feel that we've really made a difference. And what's happened is it's because people have united together across the
political spectrum because they're sick and tired of some of the bad stuff policy-wise that's going on. And so I'm optimistic, Steve, but we
need to go further.
It's certainly not enough. But I'm far more optimistic than I was a year ago because we finally sort of stopped the train going south. That
doesn't mean it's still not going south in a few little spaces. But I'm optimistic, but it's a battle. It's like a health issue. All of a sudden, you
see that your health is improving, but you still have ways to go to get -- to be at a place where you're really healthy. And I would say that's
very similar.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America.
 
Camille Bonnel
I see leasing activity improved in October with your teams signing nearly 1/3 of leases year-to-date in 1 month. Can you provide a bit more
background behind this leasing activity in the sense of how long were these conversations going on for? And how does it compare to
leases you were signing at the start of the year?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Bob, do you want to take that one?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Sure. Camille, as John said earlier, I think on this call, and he said it multiple times over the years that we're in a position right now where
decision-makers are faced with a lot of uncertainty. And if you don't have to make a decision today, you're not going to make one and
that's the prudent thing to do.
And that's borne out in the leasing that we see and why transaction velocity seems slower, and it is slower because what's happening is
on our client side, the tenant side, the real estate executives are being scrutinized more in terms of the deal that may get approved, say,
in May, by a Board of Directors or a subcommittee of a Board. It is coming back up for review in September as an example because the
Board wants to make sure it's still a viable -- is it a viable transaction for the company? Do they need it, et cetera? So that is taking more
time.
I think that we just are very prudent about how we report our leasing during earnings calls and quarter-to-quarter, but we have had quite
a few deals in our pipeline, which you see now coming to fruition in October. And I would say we have more in our pipeline, as John
alluded to, that we'll be announcing here hopefully shortly.
So it's just a complicated environment, and you've got a lot more eyes looking at transactions than you did in 2019, for example. But
again, if you have the right property in the right location, tenants are making choices and they're making decisions and some are making
longer-term decisions to lock in that space.
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'd add to that. Since Labor Day, we've seen a big increase in tours throughout all of our markets. And we've seen more deals
greenlighted that were sort of not on hold, but just going through the added scrutiny that Rob was talking about. So there's definitely
been a shift to the positive since Labor Day. We hope that continues to gain momentum. But I think that's sort of a place at which we
could say if we've seen a big difference.
 
Camille Bonnel
Okay. I appreciate the color. And second question from me. Can you comment on any sublease space, if any, in your portfolio and speak
more broadly on whether you're seeing any changes in the market, whether people are leasing or taking back space?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Camille, it's Rob again. Yes. As far as we know now, we don't have any new major blocks of sublease space in our buildings. Often, what
happens, particularly with a subtenant that comes along that is somebody would really want, we will -- we can make a direct deal. We
can do a must take at the end of the term and that sort of thing. So we do work with our tenants as well as good subtenants when we find
them.
So -- so far, I think the quality of our portfolio is bearing out that we're not seeing a high proportion of sublease space. As I said earlier,
San Francisco sublease space has remained fairly static in the 7.3 million square foot range. I would say that about 40% of that 7 million
is Class B and C space that's going to be the last to lease, if it does lease again or it will be converted to some other use at some point.
And then taking a step back across the markets, I think a fair answer to your question is that sublease space is up in most markets. But
again, it's got to be -- you really have to differentiate between contiguous floors of sublease space, which is more competitive to the
product we have versus spots of space in a building. So most markets have seen an uptick in sublease space. But you're also seeing
pretty much a supply constraint going on also as far as new development goes.
 
Operator
Our next line of question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
John, a little while back and even briefly in your open, you noted the Indeed Tower. I think the pricing was strong, while the lease-up was
slightly behind schedule. With another lease signed, can you provide an update versus plan?
And then more broadly, what makes you confident about the demand you expect to see in the Austin market going forward?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Well, I can ask Rob to comment as he's directly involved in all those deals. I'd say this, we did increase the rents dramatically and the
roster of people we're dealing with are kind of like who's who quality. And I think we're going to do extremely well in that asset. But Rob,
why don't you add some color?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Sure. Just a little more color. What we really like about the Austin market and if you look at our lease-up at Indeed, is that it's a diverse
market. So we have a mix of tech and we have a mix of professional services, and that's borne out in our tenant roster at Indeed. And that
allows us to cast a wider net in terms of who we're going after. And indeed, because of, again, the amenities, the scale of the project, the
food and just the life in the CBD is attracting both sides of tech and professional services.
And a lot of the companies, I would say, particularly on the tech side, that are expanding in Austin and continuing to expand, are doing it
because of the talent they're getting and they're locating in locations where that talent wants to be. And where the young engineers and
people coming out of college want to be. They most generally want to be in a CBD, where you have an active nightlife and things to do
after work.
So I think that's a fair description of what gives us confidence about the market. And then I can't disclose, but I just know what our
pipeline is and the negotiations and discussions we have going on, and as John said in his comments, we expect to be able to make some
more announcements.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
All right. Excellent. Look, I know you mentioned this is a market to be patient, right? But with 55% of development committed to Life
Science, that will bring the exposure to just under 1/3 of NOI. So I guess I wonder, what's the capital investment priority between at some
point at least, right, when we're not patient anymore -- between increasing Life Science exposure and/or pushing into new markets. How
do you balance both of these?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Well, I mean, that's an evolving question. Obviously, we spent 5 years analyzing Austin and looking for the right opportunity, we would
have been there earlier if we had found the quality that we wanted. But that's -- we don't have another market that we are looking at in
earnest.
We look at a lot. We always have. We're probably looking less right now. In terms of product, we have, I think, what has got to be, if not
the, one of the best-located position of life science projects in the country in KOP, that's a very proven market. We have incredible
amenities and physical characteristics of that property that people love.
As Rob mentioned, we've got some real great interest in there. And I think we're going to be very successful in Phase 2. So I look
downstream, and I go, we don't have a magic ratio with regard to what could be life science, how much should be in new markets, we're
going to be very prudent as we have been in the past. When we go into a market, it will be to establish a beachhead quickly, end up with
sufficient scale to have the right kind of people, make sure that we have a product that differentiates itself so that we're not just a
commodity or is just another player where we really think, over time, we can create a lot of value. So that's kind of the big picture.
And we're going to be flexible and you mentioned patience. I've been doing this for longer than most people in the REIT world today, a
lot longer, just [get them] over. And I've been through a lot of cycles, as a private company, I've seen near-death experiences. I've had a
lot of friends that have had death experiences in terms of business.
And liquidity is all important. And the thing I would emphasize about us. Yes, the balance sheet is in fabulous shape, liquidity is huge,
we've got plenty of capital and we have a very straightforward story. We don't -- we're not complicated, everything is pretty simple. And
we're very straightforward with our client base, and we work with them a lot about where they want to go.
That's what drove us to Austin to begin with is a number of our tech companies saying, "hey, you need to be there. You guys could really
differentiate. We like your kind of product and we think it out of -- you'd do well there". So that's just a big picture, and we'll see.
 
Operator
Our next line of question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
First question is just on the lease expirations over the next year. Hoping to get an update there on the traction you have on space. I know
last quarter, you mentioned one likely move out in San Francisco. So just to get a kind of feel for what activity is like on the expirations?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Yes. Nick, this is Rob. We have 4 expirations over 100,000 feet in '23. One of them is a known move-out, which is Pac-12, which we've
announced. The other 3 were in active discussions with, and that's about all I can say, but we continue to have dialogue with the
remaining 3.
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then in terms of the asset sales, reducing that guidance, just hoping to dig into that a little bit. Was that -- was that a situation
where you specifically brought assets to market and you got disappointing bids? Or is it just sort of informed by your color you're hearing
from the investment broker world that on a real-time basis, asset values are down by some level because debt costs are up. And so you
just chose to avoid selling right now for that reason?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
It's the latter. We actively put 3130 on the market. Eliott -- I think we had about more than a dozen bids or whatever. We had a lot of --
dozens and dozens of people signed NDAs and whatnot, so that was a fairly efficient process.
As far as the other buildings that we were thinking about, we didn't take the market. We monitor the market. We're regularly dealing
with the big brokerage companies, the Eastdils of the world and so forth. And we're also having conversations with some of the logical
buyers, not specific about an asset, but we followed them with regard to the level of activity that they have. We kind of understand what
-- who's debt dependent and the kind of debt that they like to have and the percentages and so forth.
And then a volatile, a confusing time like right now, if you're going to sell an asset, we have plenty of assets that we can sell that for
fabulous prices that are long-term leased to high-quality tenants, but we really don't want to sell those assets. And we just say to
ourselves, why sell into an inefficient market where you have fewer bidders, more contingency with regard to debt or otherwise, that
doesn't make any sense.
We've built the company around the premise of having a stalwart balance sheet. And that allows us the opportunity to be sellers when it
makes sense, but not have to sell to fund things, and that's what we've elected to do. The markets will come back. I mean, who knows
what the new normal will be. But there are a lot of things in the system right now that create uncertainty, and we've built the company to
whether the storm. And when it returns, then we'll be back as sellers of some of the properties we want to sell.

Our next line of question comes from the line of one Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.
 
Blaine Matthew Heck
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Just following up on new leasing demand. Again, we're hearing that large tenants are at least taking a step back recently. So if you could
just talk a little bit more about the profile of tenants that have active requirements in your markets and maybe some context on the size
of that requirement pipeline relative to kind of historical averages, I think that would be helpful?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Sure. Blaine, this is Rob again. As John mentioned earlier, since Labor Day, we've seen a real uptick in activity tours and actually deal
making. And that's really led by Los Angeles, San Diego and Austin. San Francisco and Seattle are a little more muted, although again,
you can't generalize and there is activity that's going on in those markets.
And as I said earlier, life science is steady with users continuing to seek out the highest quality space they can. Some examples for you
are Seattle, we have Blue Origin doing a 250,000-foot expansion not in one of our buildings, but in the Seattle market. Alaska Airlines is
growing by 120,000 square feet in Seattle. I mentioned the Google Cloud deal of 300,000 feet in San Francisco and U.S. Bank
expanding in San Francisco.
For example, in South San Francisco, recently, Astellas Pharma signed 154,000 square foot lease and NGM Bio did a renewal for 120.
And I think San Diego has just been amazing. It just has a continued expansion of FAANG. I can't -- one of the companies we do business
with has just recently expanded by another 500,000 feet down there. I can't mention the name, but it's a FAANG company. And you look
at vacancy in both Del Mar and UTC, roughly at 2%.
So I think the market dynamics are just set for these larger tenants and again, in specific markets, you're seeing activity. And when you
have quality space, you'll see activity. Is it slower than 2019? Absolutely. And are some tech companies sitting on the sidelines?
Absolutely. But you can't generalize that all tech is on the sidelines.
And if you look at the examples I just went through, it's sort of a mix between -- there's a bank, there's Google, there's Blue Origin, there
is Science, there's professional services. So that's pretty much what we're seeing. And I think the pipeline for those deals is the hard thing
to predict. What we're seeing and what we feel is that this will improve, but it will be moderate. I think John used the term sort of fits and
starts is what we see.
 
Blaine Matthew Heck
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Great, Rob, that's really helpful. Second question, you guys have a relatively strong balance sheet compared to peers, which is certainly
an advantage in this environment. But you do still have some more spend associated with your development pipeline and dispositions
are likely a little tougher, as John just talked about. So I guess how should we think about sources and uses and how leverage could
trend as we look forward?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
Blaine, this is Eliott. I can take that. I think the way to think about it, and we touched on our liquidity a little bit during the prepared
remarks, but between the cash we have and the $400 million of unsecured term loan that we raised, we have about $500 million. We
also have $1.1 billion on the line, which compares to a remaining spend of the projects under construction of about, call it, $750 million or
so.
So that gets us a lot of the way there. And frankly, the term loan that we did in the fourth quarter was $400 million, the midpoint of our
disposition guidance was $350 million. So we actually enhanced our liquidity as well. So we do think we have quite a bit of runway to
fund the pipeline. And as we get a little bit further down, we can make a decision on how to fund the balance.
But we think a lot of the near-term question has been resolved with the term loan. As far as leverage, we're about 6x now. I think what
we've said in the past is not that we intend on debt funding everything, but if we did debt fund everything just to show a sensitivity, that
6x goes up to 7x, and then once the pipeline is leased, it gets back down to around 6.

Our next line of question comes from the line of one Michael Griffin with Citi.
 
Michael Anderson Griffin
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Senior Associate
Maybe back on to leasing. Rob, I'm curious, have you noticed from prospective tenants you're talking to, anything that they're sort of
asking or looking for that they might not have been, call it, 6 to 12 months ago?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Michael, I think from a concession point of view, there haven't -- the one thing that's happening with concessions is -- and I wouldn't call
it a concession, it's just a fact of life that with inflation, tenant improvement costs have gone up. But we're not seeing anything out of the
ordinary at least in the deals we're making in terms of free rent and on cessions. What tenants are really looking for and what we are
doing with them is they're looking for partners, meaning we need to partner with them.
We have to help them in creative ways, make deals where they're having to navigate their management and their CFO. They know they
have the headcount, they know they need the space. But we're having to do creative deal structuring and that doesn't mean tons of free
rent and then a high coupon rent. So things look good.
It means figuring out how to help them grow, how to help them grow in sort of a phased way in certain cases if it's a large tenant and
working with them to really help make a transaction that works for both sides and that probably is taking more time than it did in 2018
and '19 because things are just moving at a quicker pace.
 
Michael Anderson Griffin
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Senior Associate
Maybe shifting back on to the political landscape in some of your markets. While it seems like things have improved somewhat. I think
John alluded to, you have to stop the train before returning north. I mean if you do end up seeing a deterioration in the environment from
a regulatory perspective in some of these markets, would it make sense to reallocate at some point out of some of these markets and into
Texas, maybe continued expansion there, more kind of business-friendly kind of environments?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
This is John. I think you have a good question, and I think it's sort of -- I don't need to be a smart aleck, I think it's sort of self-evident what
the answers to that would be. The -- we have a lot -- I think everybody knows, I'm kind of a hard-a** when it comes to these people
having their policies right. And I make no bones about what I think they ought to do. And if they're not doing the right thing, then forming
coalitions to try to change.
And -- so you start with that, and like we said earlier, we're starting to see some real improvement. But we probably have 40 years of
abuse in some of these cities. They've just lived in la-la land, and now they're having to come to reality. As a company, I'm not going to
make a call yet with regard to -- we should invest more in this area and less in another area. But we're pretty logical people and you had
a very logical question. And that's about as specific as I can get because I'm not going to rock boats in various places, but we talk. I don't
think you can have any doubt, Michael, about my directness, I'm kind of known for it. And I have a lot of calls with politicians every day.
 
Michael Anderson Griffin
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Senior Associate
Well, John, I think we appreciate the no nonsense and the candor there.
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Well, I got to tell you this to everybody else in the REIT industry that owns properties in these cities, I'm seeing a lot more join in, but
more need to join in. This is a battle, it's battle all over the country. And we just got to make sure that sensible minds prevail over time.
And as I said, I am encouraged. It's transcending the political landscape now because people have had enough. And I don't really need to
say more. I'll probably get into trouble, but thank you.

Our next line of questions comes from the line of one Dave Rodgers with Baird.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Eliott, I wanted to start with you. I think other income was up a little bit, not a big deal this quarter, but I wanted to ask then further about
kind of parking deferral, retail, ancillary income, how much more you might have to go in terms of a recovery against what your physical
occupancy might be and maybe how that's impacting that other income line?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
Yes. The biggest driver in the quarter and frankly, in the year-to-date is on the parking side. If you look at our same-store parking
year-to-date, we're up about $4.5 million versus last year. So we've seen tangible improvement there, mainly driven to -- as a result of
higher physical occupancy. And that's what drove both a portion of the same-store increase as well as the guidance increase.
So we're pleased about that. As far as where we go from here, tough to say, but we're not ascribing millions and millions of dollars of
upside from where we are, we think there's a little bit more room to grow there.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Appreciate that. That's helpful. On Indeed -- at Indeed Tower, can you give us an update on any time line for move-in, rent payments,
build-out, et cetera, that might impact your expectations going forward?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
Yes. So specifically around the revenue recognition for Indeed, which is what I think you're referring to. They are paying cash rent. We are
not recognizing revenue yet, and we expect to start recognizing revenue in -- sometime next year.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Any more clarity on kind of what the timing around that. Obviously, a pretty big lease, [the fact that's incumbent upon].
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
First half.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Was that first half?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
Yes.
 
David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
All right. Appreciate that. And then last one, maybe this is for Rob on the leasing front. It's a little ways out '24, the LinkedIn space. You
probably aren't talking to them yet. But I guess maybe the question would be, are they using that space? Do you expect them to stay
pretty engaged in that space? It's a fairly large size lease. And so I just wanted to kind of touch on that quickly?
 
A. Robert Paratte
Kilroy Realty Corporation - EVP of Leasing & Business Development
Yes, Dave. Silicon Valley in general has been really active in the last year, actually 1.5 years. LinkedIn loves that space. They love the
buildings. They've been in them for quite a while. We've had some inquiries from others, and I don't want to give any other color than
that. But it is a ways out, but I feel at least with what we're hearing and seeing in the market that it's going to be attractive to more than
just LinkedIn, I'll put it that way.
 
Operator
Our next line of questions comes from the line of one Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
Maybe just first one, bigger picture. You talked a lot about cycle tested, the well-positioned balance sheet, et cetera. I'm just wondering
like, assuming we see a turn in fundamentals here, from a capital deployment or broadly strategic perspective, what would you sort of
repeat as you've done in prior cycles? And what sort of either products or avenues of growth would you just completely stay away from
given this market that's become one of have and have not?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Well, I'll start with that. This is John, Vikram. So we talked a lot about over the years, the increasing obsolescence of the office stock and
that has been accelerated by COVID, and it just continues to accelerate or said another way, a larger percentage of the traditional stock is
less desirable or not desirable to an increasing group of users.
And so if I sort of think about when we got came out of 2008, 2009 and sort of began to buy property in 2010, we were very focused on
properties. They may not have been in perfect shape, but they have the bones, the physicality that we thought was important that where
we could modernize them and they would be desirable to the modern tenant. And then, of course, we bought a number of buildings,
some that were recently completed and we did a lot of development.
The problem that this transition to sort of obsolescence is made the universe of buildings or the percentage of buildings that one can buy
is sort of reduced with regard to what qualifies for us. We're not going to buy in areas we don't think have great chance to go up. They can
go up and down as we're seeing. But over time, we want to know that the location is going to go up.
And with regard to physicality, it's even -- we're even that much more fixated. And I think one of the things that has really been
interesting, I think our average age of our portfolio is 10 or 11 years.
And it was probably 12 or 13 years, 3 or 4 years ago. And why is that? Because we've sold off older stuff, and we've built so much new
stuff. And I think that's going to be the place where we are very well positioned because we understand development. We're known for
development. Our tenant base knows us to be very good developers.
And I think that's going to position us very well. That doesn't mean there won't be opportunities to buy great buildings, there may be, but
there may be too much competition there. I just don't know, so we're going to be flexible. What we're not going to do is buy a portfolio of
buildings where they're mostly old and have problems just because we want to enter a market or because it's for sale. That's just on our
style. You've not seen us do that.
The only company we bought in 25 years was a little one for $300 million, and it was almost all new product, and that was the Allen
Group in San Diego in 1997. That's -- that was it. So I think that we're just that much more resolved towards the kind of buildings that you
got to have to really have a good run over a long period of time, and we're fixated on that.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
Okay. That's helpful. I guess just on that deployment. I remember last quarter, you had talked about potentially incremental
opportunities either acquisitions or development in Austin, specifically. Can you just update us sort of where are you in that process?
What's emerging?
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Well, we do have the site we bought. I think we closed on it, and that was March or April or thereabout with Stadium, which is all
approved and entitled, and we have permitted and we're ready to go on that and if it makes sense. And we do have a number of tenants
that we're working with on that building. So we'll see what happens. But I'm not going to get into specific sites that we're looking at.
We do like The Domain area. There aren't that many opportunities there. We do like downtown. There are a couple of good opportunities
that we think are going to emerge and there are a few other areas that we're looking at, but nothing that is actionable at this time. I don't
see us loading up on new development for the foreseeable future.
Do we pick off one or two sites that might make sense? Possibly. But we're in the far more in the risk off mode given this climate than we
are on the risk on mode, and we want to make sure that if we buy something, that it is a site that is whether -- if we have to wait a cycle or
whatever, that it's still going to be good. It's not going to go bad because we overpaid for it or whatever. So that's big picture, but I can't
get into specifics because I'm not going to give our competitors that knowledge.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
Sure. Fair enough. And then just last one maybe for Eliott. So I guess -- sorry, I joined the call late, I may have missed this, but I did see a
specific occupancy updated guide or just guide in the press release on the supplement. Is this sort of a metric that you just didn't provide
this quarter? Or is it something you don't intend to provide going forward?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
Yes, what we said during our prepared remarks is that similar to what we spoke about on the call last quarter, we expect to be at the low
end of our range or about 91% on the office portfolio and resi will be around current levels, which is sort of in the mid-90% range.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
But this is -- I mean, I guess just a metric you -- one of the components of guidance eventually when you provide next year, you will have
an occupancy estimate?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
That's our plan.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Yes.
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Excuse me, I beg your pardon. This is John Kilroy, the announcer there. We didn't hear -- at least I didn't. It cut out on the name of the
person speaking, asking the question. Could you repeat that, please?
 
Operator
Yes, sir, of course, it is Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.
 
John B. Kilroy
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
My question is around the asset sales. Eliott, of the $0.07 increase in the midpoint of guidance, how much of it is just because of the
lowered asset sales outlook? And then second of all, if asset sales continue not to happen because of transaction markets or capital
markets or what have you, how do you think about funding future development going forward?
 
Eliott Trencher
Kilroy Realty Corporation - Executive VP, CIO, Interim CFO & Treasurer
So the second half of the question is similar to what Blaine discussed, asked earlier, just to reiterate there, we have $500 million of
liquidity and $1.1 billion of an untapped credit facility and call it about $750 million or so remaining in our development pipeline for
projects currently underway. If we chose to debt finance everything, we're not saying we're going to do that, we temporarily go from 6 to 7
and then back down to 6 as it gets leased.
So as far as the first part of your question, the $0.07 is roughly split equally between dispose less term loan. And so it's important to
remember that while we cut our dispo guidance, we did do a term loan, which was not in our guidance previously. So that's about half of
the delta.
The other half of delta is a combination of our revenue recognition on 2 life science projects happened a month earlier than we thought
and our parking with a few million dollars better than what we expected as well. And so that drove both the same -- the parking drove
the same-store increase as well as a portion of the guidance increase.
