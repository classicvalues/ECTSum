John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everyone. So before we dive into our strong quarterly results, I wanted to take a moment to mark the
1-year anniversary of our highly successful merger. While we knew from the outset, this was going to be an incredible transaction, we
significantly outperformed both internal and external expectations. Due to our best-in-class operating platform and the strength of our
high-quality portfolio, over the past year, KRG generated a quantum leap forward across every meaningful metric. Of the top 10 open-air
peers by total enterprise value, we rank first in year-over-year FFO growth, first in year-to-date blended cash spreads, first in NOI margin,
first in recovery ratio, and first in year-over-year decrease in G&A as a percentage of total revenue.
We rank second in net debt plus preferred to EBITDA, second in year-to-date leasing production as a percentage of our total GLA; second
in percentage of ABR coming from the Sun Belt, and second in signed-not-open NOI as a percentage of same-store NOI. We also rank
fourth in liquidity as a percentage of total enterprise value.
The numbers I've listed are remarkable, and we've demonstrated our ability to operate with the best in the industry. When you compare
metrics across our sector, we stack up much higher than we're given credit for, and I specifically wanted to call attention to that before
diving into our results.
Turning to our fantastic results, KRG generated FFO as adjusted per share of $0.48, beating consensus estimates by $0.03 and
representing a 45% increase per share over the comparable period last year. Our same property NOI growth for the quarter was 4.4%
and 4.7% year-to-date. Heath will discuss guidance and provide more details around the components of these metrics, but suffice to say,
we're continuing our streak of outperformance.
The primary driver of KRG's results has been our outstanding leasing performance. We signed 221 leases representing nearly 1.6 million
square feet this quarter, which is an all-time high for the company. To put that in context, that is 5% of our total portfolio GLA in this
quarter alone.
The strong leasing volume was bolstered by blended cash spreads for comparable new and renewal leases of 10.8%. Excluding option
renewals, blended cash spreads for comparable new and non-option renewals were 15.8%. For the first 3 quarters of 2022, we've leased
over 3.8 million square feet at blended cash spreads for comparable new and renewal leases of 12.9%. To provide some additional color
on our spectacular leasing efforts year-to-date, I'd like to highlight 3 important metrics. We achieved return on capital for comparable
new leases of 37%. Comparable non-option renewal spreads have been 11%, and our retention ratio has been just under 90%.
Leasing vacancy continues to offer us the best risk-adjusted returns available and retailer demand remains strong. The KRG portfolio and
team are firing on all cylinders. In addition to the robust leasing environment, we're making excellent progress on delivering our $38
million signed not open pipeline. Our pipeline decreased by $3 million sequentially as rent commencements moderately outpaced new
leases signed. Tenants continue to commence rent ahead of our internal budget, and the timing for the NOI to come online can be found
on Page 10 of our investor presentation.
Our team's ability to deliver spaces on time and on budget in a supply chain-constrained world is a testament to the intensity that we
have within our organization. The signed not open pipeline continues to bode well for our NOI growth trajectory as tenants commence
rent and we continue to lease additional space.
As a reminder, the $38 million of signed not open NOI is only a portion of the near-term growth opportunity as shown on Page 9 of our
investor presentation. Leasing our active developments and the balance of the portfolio to pre-pandemic levels would equate to an
additional $23 million of NOI coming online over the next few years.
On the development front, we have 4 active projects remaining with limited future capital commitments of just under $60 million. As
we've mentioned, our near-term capital outlay is primarily dedicated to leasing. In addition to our leasing efforts, our development team
continues to further enhance the value of our entitled land bank. In fact, we recently took a significant step in establishing our vision for
our adjacent land at One Loudoun.
We received rezoning approval to convert 2.9 million square feet of commercial GLA to 1,745 multifamily units and 1.9 million square feet
of commercial GLA. Adding entitled multifamily units at One Loudoun is a huge win for the project, considering the first phase of
multifamily materially outperformed the pro forma absorption rates and rents per square foot. As a reminder, we'll prudently evaluate
each parcel in our land bank to determine the highest and best use of the real estate and the best risk-adjusted returns for KRG.
The culmination of all the great things I've just discussed is allowing us to raise our 2022 FFO as adjusted guidance to a range of $1.86 to
$1.90, a $0.05 increase per share at the midpoint. We're also raising our 2022 same-property NOI growth assumption to a range of 4%
to 5%, an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint. I'm extremely proud of the KRG team's dedication and relentless efforts to produce
our strong results.
We've definitely come a long way in the past year, and we will continue to showcase our operational excellence. I'll now turn the call to
Heath.
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As we mark the 1-year anniversary of the merger, I am in awe of what our team has
been able to accomplish. Looking a little further into the past, it is evident that the sheer velocity of positive change I witnessed at KRG
over the past 4 years is unparalleled in my career. All of this change would not be possible but for the boldness of our initiatives and the
tenacity of our people.
We are in the business of fulfilling our promises to our stakeholders, and that's exactly what we've done. Project Focus in 2019, our
sector-leading COVID response in 2020, the execution of the transformational merger in 2021 and the intense integration efforts over the
course of 2022, all of these are promises kept. Here is one more. We promise to work tirelessly until we get the appropriate credit for all
the progress John noted in his remarks.
Turning to our results. For the third quarter, KRG generated $0.48 per share on an as-adjusted basis. Same-property NOI grew by 4.4%
this quarter with 260 basis points of this growth being driven by contractual rent bumps and increased occupancy, and 100 basis points
attributable to an increase in net recoveries. Due to our continued leasing outperformance and higher levels of overage rent versus our
initial expectations, our same-store results this quarter beat our internal budget.
Given our same-store guidance was increased 50 basis points to 4.5% at the midpoint, it is safe to assume that our same-store growth
for the balance of the year is expected to be largely in line with this quarter. As John noted earlier, we are raising FFO as adjusted
guidance to a range of $1.86 to $1.90, which is a $0.05 increase at the midpoint. From this point forward, we don't anticipate any further
variance between FFO as adjusted and NAREIT FFO as we've lowered our estimated merger costs to $2.5 million from $4 million which is
offset by prior period collections of approximately $2.7 million through the third quarter. $0.04 of the guidance increase is attributable to
same property NOI in the form of leasing outperformance, higher overage rent and a higher retention rate.
The other $0.01 is attributable to the change in our assumption regarding the impact of our full-year transaction activity from neutral to
$0.01 accretive. Furthermore, at the midpoint of our FFO as adjusted guidance, we kept our bad debt assumption flat at 1% of revenues.
As you look toward 2023, please refer to Page 5 of our investor presentation. While we are not in a position to discuss our internal
outlook, we have highlighted some of the components of our 2022 FFO guidance that will assist you in modeling into 2023.
On the balance sheet front, we had a very active quarter. Our net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.4x, which is in line with our long-term
target. As previously announced, this past quarter, we upsized our line of credit by $250 million, and we issued a 7-year $300 million
unsecured term loan and fixed the interest rate at 3.9%. It's important to note that our line of credit is currently undrawn, and with $1.1
billion in capacity, we have enough dry powder to satisfy all of our maturities through 2025.
As mentioned on prior calls, our goal is to retire maturing debt with proceeds from unsecured issuances once the fixed-income market
stabilizes. As previously disclosed, last December, we entered into 2 forward starting swaps for an aggregate notional amount of $150
million. We were fortunate enough to lock in the 10-year swap rate at 1.36%, which at the time was equivalent to 1.52% 10-year treasury.
Subsequent to quarter end, we cash settled both instruments when the 10-year hit approximately 4.2%, generating total proceeds of $31
million. For accounting purposes and based on our intent to issue fixed-rate unsecured debt in the future, we will be realizing the
proceeds as an offset to interest expense amortized over the next 10 years, starting in 2023.
With our leverage and liquidity profile, we feel extremely confident headed into next year. We like to say that our balance sheet is built for
all weather conditions. The news and our conversations of late have been dominated by anxiety associated with the economic gloom.
However, negative speculation regarding 2023 is useful to the extent it helps us prepare. At this point, we are fully prepared. Our time is
better spent planning for the potential opportunities that lie ahead.
Thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
A couple of questions around the guidance, the revised guidance. Heath, maybe you can help us bridge the move down from $0.48 in the
third quarter to $0.45 at the midpoint of the revised guidance for the fourth quarter. It didn't seem like there was anything really
nonrecurring in the third quarter, lease term fee income was pretty minimal. Just curious if you could maybe provide a little bit of detail
around that step down as we look forward.
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
Yes, absolutely. So first of all, there was a land sale gain, which is nearly $0.01 in the quarter. So that's sort of a onetime item. Again,
these things recur, but they're unpredictable. We also said in our investor deck on Page 5, our development fees are decelerating, and we
had some nice outperformance this quarter of overage and specialty rent and while we hope to be able to repeat that into the fourth
quarter, it's something that we can't bank on. So again, it's a slight deceleration based on some things that were, like I said, recurring but
unpredictable that happened in the third quarter.
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
I think I'd just add that it's a range, Todd. So we're giving you a range. And so far this year, we've outperformed. We would hope to be in
the top end of that range, not the midpoint, but we'll see. As Heath said, there's a couple of unpredictable things, but it's a range.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. With regard to the fee income, so yes, I see that. And I appreciate those '23 considerations that you provided in the slide deck. So
$6.6 million of fee income, what should we be thinking about in terms of how that moderates going forward? I mean what's an
appropriate range to consider relative to that $6.6 million?
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
It's a great question, Todd. We'll have some more visibility on that in February. The issue is that we're sitting on a project with a third
party that will maybe or may not commence into next year. We have the development fees from the existing project, were sort of trailing
off into '23, and then there's a potential that we'll sign up something else and have some additional fees in the back half of the year.
However, I can tell you that it's going to be less even if we start that other project. And so maybe for your purposes, thinking about it as
maybe half or a little less than half going to next year is probably the right number. But again, we'll have more visibility in February in
terms of where those fees will be and whether or not we've got other projects started.
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Yes, and we're working on it right now in the first phase. So we are hoping to take that to a continuous point. But like Heath said, we'll
wait for the final information.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then regarding the $0.01 increase in accretion from investments that were completed during the year, and that change
to the guidance. What was the driver of that?
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
At this point in the year, Todd, we don't think we're going to close anything else for the balance of the year, and we're $25 million net
acquirer at this point. So just based on the fact that the acquisitions were earlier in the year than the dispositions and that we're slightly
net acquirer, it's just the math works out to $0.01.
 
Operator
And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. .
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Just kind of curious here with RPAI kind of in the books for a year, could you just maybe walk through your experience on maybe the
performance relative to underwriting or any disconnect between the performance of that portfolio, the better mark-to-market versus the
legacy portfolio? I guess I'm just trying to get at how much of the kind of a topper on growth which could continue to be, if you guys
continue to kind of bring the value out of it?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Craig, I'm trying to understand the full question. I think we were pointing that out in our comments that the performance year-end
absolutely exceeded expectations. If you just look at where we started the year in terms of the midpoint in our guidance and we're 10%
above that now. Each quarter that has gone along, the leasing has been pretty balanced across our total portfolio. In terms of the top line
rents, they've grown each quarter as well, if that's what you're asking.
So I mean I think at this point, at year-end, as you know, we don't really look at these properties independently. We look at the totality of
the company, and we're in a really good position right now with our signed not open pipeline, our balance sheet and actually, the fact
that we have room to run on our occupancy, right?
So overall, I don't think there's any one particular thing in terms of the underwriting that is different other than the fact that we
outperformed our estimates on rent and the timing of the lease-up. I mean we significantly outperformed in those 2 categories, and
we've talked about that each quarter, and it's coming from the different elements of all of the property types that we own.
And I think it's really important that we have that balance between neighborhood centers and community centers and lifestyle and
mixed-use because we're able to generate these returns, those returns on capital we talked about north of 20% while driving FFO and
cash flow. So that may not be exactly what you were looking for in the question, but that's how we feel right now.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
No, I probably phrased it a little bit weirdly. I guess I was just trying to get at, you guys did raise guidance by about 10% this year. How
much of that may have been outperformance from RPAI versus outperformance from kind of a legacy portfolio. And as we head into '23,
is there maybe more juice from RPAI and then maybe what you guys are willing to underwrite going forward? I'm just trying to, it was just
a way of getting at is this a sort of upside that's maybe not quite as understood by the street.
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Yes. No, I appreciate that. And I think you're right, it is misunderstood. And the fact that our operating platform really has shined across
this combined portfolio. And yes, there is no doubt that in the acquired portfolio that there was opportunity for us to step in and squeeze
more out of the orange, so to speak. So yes, I mean, I think we think that continues. It's why we've kind of set it up the way we have in
terms of looking into the year-end. And again, when you have one of the very highest percentages of signed not open NOI in the space as
a percentage of your total NOI, you've got more room to run.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. No, that's helpful. And then just in the quarter, you guys had a pretty good step-up in renewal leasing versus new. I assume maybe
some of that is higher retention. I mean could you just talk about the experience you guys have over the last couple of quarters on
tenants really looking to stay in space despite rent increases and how that bodes for kind of the '23 role?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Sure. Tom, you want to hit that?
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Yes. I would say there's no question about the fact that the overall demand generators have really helped us in terms of our ability to
both maintain and secure new tenancy. We're in a position right now that we have a limited amount of space, and as part of that, the
demand is truly outpacing what we have. So we're hoping that situation continues, and that is then the basis for us for being able to
generate strong returns, and be able to generate the numbers that we're reporting here today.
But we like where we are at this point, we'll proceed for us forward in a cautious manner, but all indications, if you look at our pipelines
through the fourth and first quarter are not showing slowdowns.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. And then if I could slip one more in for Heath. Just on the amortization and derivative gain, I missed when, how many years that's
going to be amortized over, and I just assume it's probably just ratable. Is that the way to look at it?
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
It was a 10-year swap, so it's over a 10-year term, and that amortization will start in 2023.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.
 
Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division - MD and Head of United States REITs
I guess my first question, just, again, I greatly appreciate all the comments and the great presentation comparing your metrics versus the
peers. So just trying to pinpoint what you think the disconnect is? Is it too much of a focus, let's say, on average size center,
demographics? Is it maybe just a few quarters where you consistently are delivering these type of numbers to close that multiple gap?
What are your thoughts?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Jeff, yes, look, I mean, I wish we knew the specific answer to that. I think our job is to lay out the disconnection and then work to fix that, I
think when we look at the total picture, part of it -- I mean, instinctually, I would say when a company does a major merger a year ago, it
more than doubles in size at a complex time in the world.
I think there was a lot of people wanted to see a show-me story. And I think we've clearly, clearly, clearly shown them, and now we just
need to get people to understand that you're looking at a company that stacks up as one of the best in this open-air shopping center
business, but is priced in an opposite way. So I can't tell you exactly, Jeff. I mean when you talk about demographics, our demographics
are strong. The 3-mile average household income and 3-mile population are both over 100,000, we're in the Sun Belt. We have a good
mixture of grocery-anchored properties. So we check the boxes, and more importantly, we've outperformed. I mean, we've just flat-out
outperformed, and that was what I laid out in my opening remarks. So when you have this combination of quality real estate, one of the
best teams in the business and outperformance, we do not understand why it's not reflected.
 
Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division - MD and Head of United States REITs
Thanks, John, fair comments. My second question then is just on the signed but not opened, just what are the risks, I guess, if you think
about the next 12 months, at least on the opening in particular anchors, is there any risks around these signed leases and openings
compared to your chart where you lay out kind of the expected income over the coming years.
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Well, I will tell you one thing and part of this relates to our construction backgrounds and a group that has been doing this for a
tremendously long time, we have a mentality that we're going to figure out whatever it takes to make it happen. And I will tell you that
we're sourcing parts in China. We're looking for different components for switchgear. We're trying to figure out the pre-sourced
mechanical units, so there's a tremendous amount of work that goes on to make sure we hit these dates.
But I think you can be assured that the team's got a lot of experience on how to deal with issues. We have a building right now that has
an 800-amp service in it, and we're not going to have permanent power for a while, and we're figuring out how to get underground
power to it. So we're going to figure it out, and that's our mentality. But it's a battle. I will tell you that but that's what this team does. So
we have confidence in our ability to deliver at the end of the day.
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
I mean, Jeff, bottom line, though, if you look at what we've done this year, we've delivered on time this year. In fact, we've been ahead of
schedule, so I think what Tom is referring to is this is another reason to own this company because we have the background, we have the
strength in a particularly complicated world and construction that a lot of our other peers don't have because that's how this company
started.
It was a construction company when it started. And we don't anticipate that we'll have any problems continuing to do that next year in
2023. And frankly, when you do have a problem, it's 30 days, it's 60 days, whatever. The rents coming. So this idea that maybe people
don't understand what signed-not-open means, that rent is coming. It's a matter of which month it's coming in, and we lay it out in our
investor presentation as good as we can, and we believe that that's pretty accurate.
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Our job is drive to hit it is the bottom line.
 
Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division - MD and Head of United States REITs
Thank you for the comments. I guess to clarify that, we still get that question in particular, again, on the anchors, are there any clauses
where the anchor could still back out?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
I mean, in general, obviously, you've got -- you cannot overcategorize something like that. Each deal is different. Every lease has some
nuance to it. But when you're talking in general, that's not a big risk of anchors backing out. Generally once you're under construction, it's
really all on the landlord, and you've got times built in for cure, et cetera. It would be rare. I mean, is it possible? Of course, it's possible,
but it would be very rare.
We can't remember the last time. I mean honestly...
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
It has not happened to us within the last decade, I guess...
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Very rare. But I'm glad you bring that up, Jeff. If that is a question, I think people are missing a lot of potential upside there for us.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Wesley Golladay with Baird.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Congratulations on getting the new zoning at Loudoun. I'm just curious if you're going to do more of the residential yourself or you're
going to lift the joint venture of the platform.
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
I think like we talked about, Wes, I mean, we're going to analyze this, like we're going to analyze every land parcel that we own. I think
we've mentioned in the past we generally like to look at these from the perspective of what is our -- what's the highest return on capital
we can get in any particular situation. So we haven't determined yet exactly what the structure will be.
I mean we just got the rezoning within the last few weeks. The point I think we're trying to make is that the land value has a significant
bump relative to what's going on in that particular market in multifamily. So we'll just take that one step at a time. But whatever we do,
we're going to maximize the value for KRG.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Got it. And then as we look to next year, I'm not looking for guidance, but is there any other moving parts that we should be aware of. We
discussed the fees. We discussed the swap. One of the questions we're getting is, is there anything on the noncash fair value adjustments
as we go into next year? Anything along those lines? Or any other things you want to call out that may be onetime in nature?
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
No. We set them all forth on Page 5 of the investor presentation. There's nothing occult happening in the noncash. So again, we're not
prepared to give our outlook for 2023, but we don't expect any noncash surprises.

Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler.
 
Connor Mitchell
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst
I guess just looking at a big picture view. So we see the headlines of inflation and impact on people's abilities to shop retailers with
tougher range of sales, but what you guys are talking to your tenants and the retailers. Does it seem like there's any correlation to their
demand and maybe if they're changing their real estate positioning?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
No. I mean not at this point, as we pointed out, I think, in our remarks and our results, at this point, we continue to see strong demand for
an ever shrinking supply base in Class A open-air retail, which is what we own. Sometimes people like to draw these correlations that are
second derivatives that don't necessarily happen right away. I would say that our conversations now continue to be long-term
conversations, and we've mentioned this before that when you're dealing with a quality retailer, they're thinking about their physical real
estate in the sense of decades, not months, right?
So these are decisions that are generally decade-long decisions, investments in that platform. And I think it's been pointed out on other
earnings calls, it's pretty darn clear that the profitability in retail is generated in the physical space. There's a lot of reasons why you do
other types of retail. But if you're looking to make money, you need physical space. So I think that kind of combination of things is really
great for us. And we take it one month at a time in terms of the overall economy. But right now, it continues to be pretty strong.
 
Connor Mitchell
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just kind of sticking with the big picture theme, maybe narrow it down to the markets and the
different regions you guys are in. I mean, you pointed out that you're in the Sun Belt, but I guess just is more of the focus staying on the
Sun Belt? Or are you guys also looking at some of the higher growth -- highest growth markets that you point out in your IR deck. It
seems that a lot of your acquisitions are in the Sun Belt or southern regions versus dispositions being further north. So if you guys could
just touch on the market's update.
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Sure. I mean, yes, we definitely are and have been focused on the Sun Belt markets, I mean, but we are also very fortunate to own
extremely high-quality real estate in some major metros such as New York, Seattle, Chicago, et cetera, that would not be on that Sun
Belt kind of definition, but when you own 200 properties and you're looking at growth rates and you're looking at opportunities to
increase cash flow, that's really what's driving our decision-making, but we continue to be very enamored with the markets that we're in.
And as I've pointed out in the past, we're the only open-air major player that 40% of the revenue comes from Texas and Florida. So you
can't deny that those 2 states are very, very important. That doesn't mean that there aren't other markets that are important and there
aren't other markets that we're in. So I think our balance is very good, and we'll continue to grow where we see appropriate going
forward.

And our final question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Seems like the 19 signed not occupied coming online in '23 is a nice cushion. Could you remind us the expectation for bad debt this year
and what you're thinking about for '23.
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
Bad debt this year, as I said in my remarks that the assumption is 1% of revenues. And then I'd like to sort of pass on the next question. In
February we'll have a better view on where we think bad debt will be for 2023. And we took a very conservative approach this year,
started out with 150 basis points into 2022. I wouldn't be surprised if we're looking in 2023, we take a conservative approach, probably
not as conservative as 150 basis points, but maybe a little bit higher than what our historical average is based on just some of the
headwinds we're seeing. So again, it's something that we'll have a lot more clarity on in February, when we give our full year guidance.
But again, I think it's going to be prudent for us to remain conservative on our assumption.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Helpful. And then nice same-store NOI growth momentum and raising guidance by 50 basis points. How are you thinking about it
preliminarily same-store NOI growth for '23?
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
It's going to be good. We've got obviously a stacked SNO pipeline. In addition, we had leases that turned on last quarter that are going to
be fully annualized into 2023 as well. So we're -- at this point in time, and again, it's -- we'll know more in February, and we're going
through our budget season here in November to relook at all of our assumptions heading into '23, but the preliminary outlook is that
we're looking at a very, very strong same-store NOI heading into next year.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Got it. And then why did merger integration cost estimate -- why did that go down so much?
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
There were some technology items that we had conservatively budgeted to be higher than they were, and some of those items were,
again, just was less costly, some of those items were going to trickle into next year. So again, it's just basically technology costs.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Got it. Just one last one for John. When you look across the different formats, community, neighborhood, mixed-use power, where are
you seeing the most leasing competition from retailers?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Well, I mean, I think it's competitive across the board, Linda. I mean, I think probably the segment that has picked up a ton this year, as
we pointed out in the past, is the Lifestyle segment. So we've seen real strength there, but we've also seen real strength really across the
board. So I just think -- again, I'm going to pound the table as one person put it. We're in a shrinking supply world. So the macro is maybe
a little less sensitive in the sense of this idea that we have headwinds.
I mean I hear that, I understand that. But the reality is, as I said, these tenants are making really long-term decisions, they have limited
quality space, and they're moving around. I mean, as we said before, I mean, we did an Adidas deal, for example, in a power center, and
it's performing extremely well. You look at Total Wine and what they're doing and the different types of properties that they're going in. I
mean, I can give you a long list, Tom can give you even a longer list, I think that it's actually pretty strong across the board is what I'm
trying to say.
 
Operator
And we do have an additional question from Christopher Lucas with Capital One...
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
Okay. All right. I started before maybe -- anyway, I missed a bunch of the call. I just wanted to find out, and if you touched on it, do not
worry about it. But big spike in the maintenance CapEx for the quarter. Was that specific to Ian?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
No, it was not Ian, sorry. Everybody -- that was definitely not Ian. But go ahead, Tom.
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Yes. So on the -- go ahead, Chris.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
I was just going to say what drove that big spike?
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Yes. So the spike related to a couple of items. One is we're coming out of COVID, which delayed some of the process. The other one was
we were really trying to contemplate what is the best way to spend this capital during this inflationary supply chain situation that we had.
So we moved some things out of roof because of pricing being so high, brought them down in the parking lots. So we were really
maneuvering, trying to get the best bang for our buck. And that really pushed us to create this higher spend towards the end of the year.
And then I think the final thing, Chris, is we spent a lot of time going through the portfolio through the merger. And we wanted to make
sure that everything in the portfolio met the standards. And there were some things that we wanted to address to make sure we had
consistency throughout the platform. So that's an overview, but it was really just the timing and a lot of hard work going in to make sure
we got the best pricing possible.
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
I mean say it another way, Chris, I mean, we have strong free cash flow. So we're investing in the properties, as Tom said. So I don't think
there's a particular one reason and some of it's seasonal, by the way. But going into next year, we will continue to spend and invest in
these properties, and that's one of the beauties of having good free cash flow.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
And then Tom, while I have you, so you got a good strong SNO for next year, what is the likelihood at this point that sort of your pipeline
of deals will contribute to next year's ABR?
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
I can't be too specific, but we have a very nice pipeline of boxes coming up, and so I think we're going to continue to see nice growth in
that area. I was just looking at that list as we came in. But we feel like our run is going to continue into 2023. And then obviously, we're
going to try to open as many of these projects as possible based upon my previous comments and get them done in the most efficient
way. But we still have a lot of gas in the tank in terms of pushing those that signed NOI.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
Are you guys running into any permitting delays? Or is it mostly supply chain that impacting it, if at all, your ability to get
commencements...
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
Chris, I was down in Florida last week, and we were touring all the properties that ran into issues. We were very fortunate to end up with a
number of damage around $1.5 million. So we're -- we felt very good about that, and the group is already jumping on, taking care of
those and getting them fixed as quickly as possible. So overall, I mean, I think we feel pretty good in terms of where we are on that whole
front.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
And then last one for you guys for me is the operating margin, recovery rates all bounced up nicely, at least on my numbers, one of them
is at a record level. I guess I'm just trying to understand, is all of the opportunity that you saw in the RPAI portfolio fully rented out now in
terms of those kinds of metrics? Or is there more opportunity to come?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
No, I don't -- we don't think that we've gotten where we want to get, Chris, and we have more room to push there. I think as we pointed
out in the past, there's many ways to do that, but one of them that we were very successful with historically was fixed CAM and the RPAI
portfolio was at -- basically had no fixed CAM, so we've gone from maybe about 50% to probably 35%. That's off the top of my head, but
I know it's close. So there's room to run there and then just getting more and more efficient in the way that we operate and then also how
we price things. So I think we hope that we continue to press that, just like we'll continue to press our leased percentages, we still have
good room to run. So I'm really excited about the opportunity to get back to pre-COVID levels.

And our next question comes from Paulina Rojas-Schmidt with Green Street.
 
Paulina A. Rojas-Schmidt
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Analyst of Retail
The Albertsons and Kroger merger was a reminder of the risk of seeing further consolidation in that industry. So I'm intrigued about how
you think about this risk, broadly speaking, not just related to this merger. And if you incorporate that in any way in your listing decisions
when you evaluate grocer deals?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Look, I think in any industry that has potential consolidation, you're always looking and trying to think through how your portfolio is
affected by that. In this particular situation, we don't see this as a big risk to our portfolio. Our largest grocer is Publix which is an
extremely strong independent private grocer.
So in particular, in the grocery sector, I don't see this as a massive risk to us. And I think, quite honestly, it's why we continue to talk about
how important it is to have a balanced portfolio when it comes down to the property types. And I think people misunderstand that and
misprice that.
So we love the fact that we have the diversity in the different property types, we still have 75% of our centers or so have some sort of
grocery component associated with them. But that's a good thing, and we don't see a massive risk of future consolidation, and then when
you get into the other retailer types, the value players, et cetera, it's probably less of an issue than it is in the grocery space. But so far,
not a huge issue to us in particular.
 
Heath R. Fear
Kite Realty Group Trust - Executive VP, Corporate Secretary & CFO
And Paulina specifically, just to put some numbers around Kroger Albertsons merger, we have 17 units, 10 of them are Kroger, 7 are
Albertsons, represents about 1.9% of our ABR, so not a huge exposure there. And also, we did a 3-mile study for overlap, which arguably
in the grocery world is a larger radius than necessary. And we only have two overlaps, one in the Chicago area and one in the Dallas area.
And the one in the Chicago area is already operating under the same flag, so they're already competing with each other. So we feel very
good that this merger is going to be transparent to us. That's -- if the merger goes through, you may have seen the news this morning, a
couple of the state attorney generals are now challenging the merger. So we'll see -- they've got a little bit of work to do to get it done.
 
Paulina A. Rojas-Schmidt
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Analyst of Retail
Yes, it seems it will be a long process. And then the other question I have is do you know of any Bed Bath & Beyond for closing your
portfolio?
 
John A. Kite
Kite Realty Group Trust - Chairman of the Board of Trustees & CEO
Any Bed Baths closing? No, I mean, we obviously have -- we have some Bed Baths that have lease expirations. And so there's potential
that upon those lease expirations, I think a couple of them in '23, two of them expire, so they may potentially close, but that's not
unusual. But no, we don't know of any premature closings. And candidly, we have very strong real estate there. The Bed Bath component
of that company versus Buy Buy Baby, for example, the Bed Baths are generally lower rents. So it could be a very good opportunity for us.
 
Thomas K. McGowan
Kite Realty Group Trust - President & COO
We have studied all of our stores other than the ones that go through the natural expirations. And if you take a look at our sales the way
our stores are positioned, we feel pretty confident in terms of where they are. We, of course, talk to Bed Bath & Beyond and their advisers
consistently. So we're keeping a close eye, but we like our position in terms of the specific stores themselves.
