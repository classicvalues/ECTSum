Brian Dale Mitts
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Executive VP of Finance, Secretary, Treasurer & Director
Actually, it will be, Brian. Thanks, Kristen, and I appreciate everyone joining today. I'm going to kick things off going through our Q3 and
year-to-date results. And then I'll touch on guidance for the fourth quarter and then turn it over to the team for some detailed
commentary.
Q3 results are as follows: Third quarter, we reported net loss of $0.54 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.17 per diluted share
for the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in net income as a result of lower prepayments in Q3 and mark-to-market adjustments on the
CMBS portfolio. Interest income increased 14% over Q3 2021, driven by a 76 basis point increase in average yield on investments. Interest
expense increased 37%, driven by $102 million of additional borrowings and a 98 basis point increase in average rate.
Earnings available for distribution was $0.48 per diluted share in Q3 compared to $0.51 per diluted share in the same period of 2021.
Cash available for distribution was $0.50 per diluted share in Q3 compared to $0.62 per diluted share in the same period of 2021. The
decrease in earnings available for distribution and cash available for distribution was the result of lower prepayments in Q3. We paid a
dividend of $0.50 per share in the third quarter, and the Board has declared a dividend of $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter. Our
dividend in the third quarter was 0.96x covered by earnings available for distribution and 1x covered by cash available for distribution.
Book value per share decreased 4.2% quarter-over-quarter to $20.68 per diluted share, partially as a result of the mark-to-market
adjustments in the CMBS portfolio. During the quarter, we originated or purchased 9 investments with $113 million of outstanding
principal with a combined current yield of 8.3%. 4 investments were redeemed or sold with $27.5 million of outstanding principal for a
total net loss of $731,000.
Year-to-date results are as follows: For the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, we reported net income attributable to common
shareholders of $0.71 per diluted share compared to net income of $3.02 per diluted share for the same period of 2021. This decrease is
largely driven by mark-to-market adjustments in our CMBS portfolios.
Earnings available for distribution was $2.25 per diluted share year-to-date compared to $1.35 per share -- per diluted share in the same
period of 2021, an increase of 67.5%. Cash available for distribution was $2.69 per diluted share year-to-date compared to $1.57 per
diluted share in the same period of 2021, an increase of 72.1%. Higher year-over-year earnings available for distribution and cash
available for distribution for the year were driven by higher prepayments and requisite prepayment penalties in the first and second
quarters. Our dividend for the year was 1.5x covered by earnings available from distribution and 1.8x covered by cash available for
distribution.
Now let's move to guidance for the fourth quarter. For fourth quarter, we're guiding to earnings available for distribution and cash
available for distribution as follows: Earnings available for distribution of $0.53 per diluted share at the midpoint with a range of $0.48
on the low end and $0.58 on the high end. Cash available for distribution of $0.52 per diluted share at the midpoint with a range of
$0.47 on the low end and $0.57 in the high end. The increase in cash available for distribution and earnings available for distribution
from the third quarter is driven primarily by new investments in the portfolio.
So with that, let me turn it over to team for the detailed commentary.
 
Matthew X. Goetz
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - SVP of Investments & Asset Management
Thanks, Brian. The third quarter continued to show strong performance across each of our investments and asset classes. As of today,
the portfolio is currently comprised of 83 individual investments with approximately $1.7 billion of total outstanding principal. The loan
portfolio is 96% residential with 42% invested in senior loans collateralized by single-family rental and 54% invested in multifamily,
primarily via Agency CMBS. The remaining 4% of the loan book is life sciences and self-storage.
The portfolio's average remaining term is 5.6 years is 93% stabilized has a weighted average loan-to-value of 68.1% and an average debt
service coverage ratio of 1.76x. The portfolio is geographically diverse with the bias towards the Southeast and Southwest. Texas, Georgia
and Florida, combined for approximately 49% of our exposure on a geographic basis. All of our investments are current.
Moving to the opportunities we were able to take advantage of during this quarter and shortly thereafter. Through today, we were able to
close 11 new investments totaling $132 million with a weighted average unlevered yield of 9% and an average levered yield of 11.2%. $9
million of mezzanine investments were made, collateralized by a stabilized self-storage property located near Miami, Florida with an
unlevered yield of 11%. $21.5 million in 3 separate preferred equity investments collateralized by stabilized multifamily properties located
in Plano and Fort Worth, Texas and Parkland, Washington at a weighted average estimated yield of 13.3%. A $15 million preferred equity
investment also closed collateralized by stabilized life sciences CDMO property outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota yield of 10%. The
tenant is well-capitalized group and signed a long-term lease at the property. $1.5 million of MSCR notes with an estimated leverage
yield of 13.8% closed; and $85.1 million of CMBS, including the Freddie Mac B-Piece with an average unlevered yield of 7.6% and levered
yield of 12.9% closed shortly after the quarter.
In summary, we continue to find attractive investments throughout our target markets and asset classes, and we'll continue to evaluate
these opportunities with the goal of delivering value to our shareholders.
I'd now like to hand the call over to Paul Richards.
 
Paul Richards
Thanks, Matt. During the third quarter, the company was active in the primary bond market and was awarded a $70.5 million Freddie
Mac floating rate B-Piece. An attractive yield at SOFR + 525 and a levered yields in the low to mid-teens, which has prudently levered via
attractive price repo financing. The bond [bodes] a great geographical presence, prudent underlying loan leverage and as always,
excellent sponsorship.
We struck the entire CMBS portfolio by shocking cap rates and NOI growth to determine how far our cap rates could theoretically widen
and interest rates could rise until the bond performance will deteriorate. The results were somewhat as expected. The vast majority of the
portfolio has shown strong NOI growth over the past few years and refi risk is minimal even at these stressed rates. We continue to be
sensibly leveraged on the repo at roughly 60% LTV at quarter end and have constant dialogue with our great repo lending partners on
the state of the market and the repo CMBS portfolio.
Lastly, touching on the continued performance of the SFR loan pool in the Q3 2022 loan pay down. All SFR loans are currently
performing and demonstrated strong metrics in terms of rent growth in occupancies as the demand for single-family rental growth is still
red-hot. The portfolio has one SFR loan payoff in the third quarter, which generated an IRR of 22% as compared to the original
underwritten IRR of only 9%. Due to the early prepayment penalty, the investment was able to generate outsized net proceeds than the
original underwriting ended roughly 1/3 of the original investment time horizon.
To finalize our prepared remarks before we turn it over to questions, I'd like to turn it over to Matt McGraner.
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Thank you, Paul. As the team has mentioned, NREF's credit investments and primarily stabilize shorter-term lease duration assets with
lower CapEx -- had and should continue to maintain dynamic pricing power in today's inflationary environment. Underlying NOI
embedded in our stabilized SFR multi and storage collateral continue to outperform other property types, providing a resilient base of
earnings for distribution and stable yields to our investors. Though moderately decelerating from historical peaks earlier this year,
same-store NOI growth in multifamily SFR and storage are still pushing high single to low double digits.
On the origination front, the team continues to put capital to work in our core property types at accretive yields. And in addition, we
believe this market is right for us to generate more of our special situation, tactical type of investments for well-yield sponsors to take
advantage of the lack of liquidity in the private markets, especially as it relates to multifamily portfolio transactions and single-family
rental, particularly in the build to rent space.
We're also pleased with the lack of transitional assets or business plans within our portfolio. Indeed, we're not -- we're thankfully not
speaking to you today discussing transitional business plans on office or other longer-term duration assets.
And finally, it's an exciting time for our business and that our portfolio enjoys a stable and transparent earnings stream for the next
5-plus years, from which we can utilize our deep relationships and frankly, our own investment platforms across multi SFR storage and
life sciences to continue to generate outside risk-adjusted returns to our investors.
I thought I have -- for prepared remarks. Now we'd like to turn the call over to the operator to answer any of your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we'll first hear from Stephen Laws of Raymond James.
 
Stephen Albert Laws
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
I guess maybe Matt McGraner, maybe start with a bigger picture question. With mortgage rates going to 7%, where they are, can you talk
about what impact you expect that to have on your SFR and multifamily, kind of -- as this rolls through, do you expect higher renewal
rates? How do you expect to look at occupancy or expect increases there? Maybe talk about the buying a home becoming less affordable
and how that benefits your SFR multifamily investments?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes, I think it's -- you're alluding to it, but you're exactly right. Everything that is doing right now is making home affordability any easier
across the multifamily loan growth and then our equity portfolio. We're seeing retention rates -- retention rates go from 40% -- excuse
me, 45% to 50% climbing to 55%, 56% in sort of the affordability workforce space, which is largely what our CMBS portfolio makes up as
well.
Same thing on the SFR piece, our platform there (inaudible) and our other platforms continue to see really high retention, especially
again in that affordable space. And I would expect with the lack of construction financing out there, the supply is going to even decrease
for developers. New starts have fallen off of a cliff in the second half of the year. And we think multifamily supply peaks in late '23. And
'24 to '25 will probably be pretty good years for both equity investors in this space and on the credit side.
 
Stephen Albert Laws
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Great. When we think about new investments, when you look at things on a relative attractiveness, money going to work in mezz, I
appreciate, Matt, guess highlighting the new investments, some new private equity investments -- preferred equity investments to, I
think. But can you talk about how those stack up from a return standpoint versus considering stock repurchases, just given the weakness
here ahead of the quarter and where book value came in north of 20%?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. I think the idea is probably to balance it in a barbell strategy and do both. Thankfully, as you might recall in Q2, we had $150 million
of pipeline for the rest of the year. Roughly $115 million of that has been soaked up. And so we're pretty pleased with the growth profile
over the next 12 months from external investments. So -- to the extent that we stay at 75% of book value, that might be our first use of
free cash flow on the margin. But otherwise, I think it'd be a barbell.
 
Stephen Albert Laws
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Great. And my last question for now. On the 2 common stock investments, can you give us an update on those and how you're thinking
about investment time line and returns or considerations of reallocating anything into cash flowing debt investments?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. I'll start with the storage piece, and I'll kick it to Paul to talk about the ground lease investments. So on the storage side, we're
seeing within our own portfolio, pretty dramatic same-store NOI growth, eclipsing 25-plus percent and then in '22, '23, we think, could
be low teens as well. Rents in kind of in the same realm. We just closed on the senior side of the portfolio at SASB right after Labor Day
with JPMorgan at accretive levels. So we were sorting out the capital stack. That was the first piece. The second piece is ongoing with
Extra Space discussions in terms of delevering their preferred. And I would expect that we would have a resolution there by year-end at
an accretive level for the common equity. So pretty pleased with how the portfolio is performing and also pleased with the cap stack
maneuvering that we've been able to achieve so far this year in this environment. Paul, you will talk about...
 
Paul Richards
Yes, definitely. On our ground lease investment right now, they're rolling on all cylinders right now. They have dry powder that are
deploying at 4.5-plus percent cap rates on stabilized ground leases. So it's stabilized assets. So they have a very good runway into the
[egress] of this year and next year to take advantage of what's going on in the marketplace, which is a lack of liquidity on the credit side.
So they're able to fill that gap with [Visa] with the types of investments. So I think that they really have to stride at the right time. And
with this dry powder, it's going to be good in the next 12 to 18 months. So I think in terms of exit, call it, 3, 4 years, maybe 2 to 4 years, but
I think there's also a market possibly for an exit too -- since we have such a small piece of the equity as well. So it's -- I think we're -- I
think it's a great time to be in this investment.
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. Particularly just to add to that, Stephen. These are both kind of bite-size check sizes and really great portfolios to the extent that we
found the special sit or other use of proceeds that we thought was more accretive. We have a number of external parties, quite frankly,
internal parties to monetize these 2 assets. So pretty good optionality.
 
Operator
Next we'll hear from Steven Delaney of JMP Securities.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
It was nice to be on with you on the call and also to be active from a research perspective. I was wondering you guys have had a great
track record with the Freddie K-Series. We've been reading lately just trying to keep up with all the problems in the CLO market that
Freddie is starting to crank up this Q-Series again with multifamily bridge loans. Just wondered if you're looking at that? I know you're --
you prefer stabilized rather than transitional properties. But as this develops and expands, could you see yourself getting involved in the
Q-Series as well as with the K that you've done so well with?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. Thanks, Steve. This is Matt McGraner. And pleasure to talk to you and appreciate the coverage. We have had a long history, as you
noted, with Freddie and have iterated with them all in a number of entrepreneurial and creative things that they try to do. We'll continue
to do that with the Q-Series. I think it's in the early stages. So to the extent that we think it's an attractive investment for this portfolio, we
will look at it. But on the other things that we're doing with them, we'll -- I think, largely still prefer this stabilized property types, the
K-Series.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
And with the K-Series, obviously, those are fixed rate term loans, mostly 10 years, I guess, in this move up in coupons. I suspect when we
see reports from Walker & Dunlop, Arbor Realty, et cetera, that we're going to see a dramatic slowdown. So is it your expectation when
you're sort of looking at the portfolio out into '23 anyway that there's going to be a big drop in issuance?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. I think that largely the K-Series that we've done have been floating. So we're actually benefiting from the (inaudible) Yes, the
[LIBOR] moves. But you're right, you hit on the team that's going on right now. So to the extent that there's refi activity or purchase
activity, most sponsors are floating today (inaudible) given that they don't want to put on fixed rate debt at 5.5% to 6% levels, and that's
pretty material negative leverage if you believe cap rates are still sub-5% -- 4.5% to 5%, which we do. So most of the product, I think,
over the next 6 months to 9 months will be skewed on the floating side, would be my guess.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
Yes, it makes sense. And it depends on your view on the Fed, but [air] thinking here is that we're going to get a pivot sometime in the
second half of '23, and we'll just then see how far we move back down the hill, so to speak.
Just one last quick one. We're not -- it's -- we've got a major disruption as we've been talking about. We don't know how long it will last,
hopefully -- hopefully not. But let's just say the -- this [mess] continues well through 2023. Do you think you could see some situations
where there will be needs for rescue financing by borrowers or even seeing banks capitulate and be selling some loans at an attractive
discount? I know we're not there now, but is that something you would be prepared to take advantage of if this thing gets really bad?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes. So we -- if you go back to COVID, there was a great opportunity that lasted about 3 weeks to buy (inaudible) dislocated [securities],
and we did as much as we possibly could, but there was just so much capital on the sidelines that soaked up pretty (inaudible) I do think
an interesting research project for someone would be to go pull gateway office assets that are 40 years old or longer that are held by
either CMBS or banks at the basis of whatever the per square foot basis of the loan is that I think probably are in trouble or will be in
trouble that could be an interesting set of weakness, but I don't think you'll see us dip into that space, but I do think that's probably
where the size of the trust probably first illuminate.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
Yes. That's where we're seeing all the 4 and 5 rated loans with the commercial mortgage REITs, that's for sure is the office space.
 
Operator
Next, we hear from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Do you have any view on home prices and where you think they will go in 2023? What would your guess or estimate be for magnitude of
home price decline?
 
Brian Dale Mitts
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Executive VP of Finance, Secretary, Treasurer & Director
Yes. Jade, it's Brian Mitts. From an SLR perspective, I think you got to distinguish it from housing itself. Obviously, housing prices, I think,
are going to decline or decelerate and increase if not decline. But I think from the SFR perspective, we're seeing really strong rent growth
and high occupancies. I think Invitation has reported already. But as Matt mentioned, within our private portfolio, which is quite large.
We haven't seen a deceleration of rents. We've seen good NOI growth. So I think that we're not going to see the same type of decline in
asset values in that context. So I think SFR has still got great fundamentals.
I think if you look across our loan portfolio at the underlying assets, that's very similar. So we may see a little retracement just depending
on kind of where cap rates go and where they're at is kind of anyone's guess at this point. Just the transaction volume is pretty thin across
really all sectors. But it certainly hasn't moved in tandem with interest rates. And I think that you're not going to see the same type of
value degradation in SFR [is all] in housing in general.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. They did report Invitation Homes and their stock is down 8.5% today. Just -- definitely weakness in their results.
 
Brian Dale Mitts
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Executive VP of Finance, Secretary, Treasurer & Director
Yes, their expenses, I think, were quite high and surprised to the downside on a core FFO or FFO decrease in our guidance. But I think the
public markets and private markets were up so far, I think, are very disconnected as well.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. Where do you think multifamily either prices in absolute nominal terms or cap rates to go also -- similar prices?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes, it's Matt McGraner. I think -- so we're marketing ourselves on the equity side portfolio, Sunbelt portfolio today. And bids are coming
in and spot cap rates around 4.5% levels. There's a couple of data points out in the market on larger portfolios, $500 million plus that
are non-Sunbelt or partially Sunbelt that are eclipsing 5% today. So kind of taking those 2 data points from what we see. And there's not
a lot of transaction activity, as you know. But if you got to sell, it's probably a 4.5% to 5% cap rate today and then the bid sheets aren't as
deep as they were certainly in the first half of the year.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. And so to finance that you'd be in the 6s on a cost of debt or high 5s?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
It depends if you go fixed or floating. If you go floating, you're probably 200 over the SOFR rate. So yes, on a floating basis. And then on a
fixed rate basis, the spreads to the 10-year largely been 150 to 175 is what we're seeing. Commission business on the agency side, they'll
tight spreads probably 20 to 30 basis points on both floating and fixed.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
20 to 30 basis points?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
Yes.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. And so what do you think the IRR is on those kinds of deals?
 
Matthew Ryan McGraner
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - Executive VP & CIO
On a leverage basis, probably high single digits on a 5-year hold, if you have growth. If not, it's certainly less than that. There's too much
negative leverage right now in the multifamily space. So something's got to give on an unlevered basis, which could -- where we think
you'll probably see most of the activity in the latter half of the year or in the first half of the year, [all] these core funds that are buying
core plus products. And I think that they're underwriting to an unlevered probably 6% or 7% return over a 10-year hold.
 
Brian Dale Mitts
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. - CFO, Executive VP of Finance, Secretary, Treasurer & Director
Operator, are there any other questions?
 
Operator
There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.

free to reach out to the team here, and we'll be happy to answer them. Thank you.
