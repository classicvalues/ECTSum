Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to share that Postal Realty had a strong third quarter. And we are well
positioned to continue executing on our goal of creating and growing shareholder value. Postal Realty's business model is anchored with
stable cash flows supported by our credit tenant and is further enhanced with organic growth from our short-term lease duration, which
allows for the continual mark-to-market of rents.
With minimal exposure to variable rates, low leverage, and no notable debt maturities until 2026, our balance sheet is ideally situated to
continue executing our growth strategy. We continue to consolidate this highly fragmented market through sourcing accretive
acquisition opportunities, particularly core last mile and flex property, while maintaining our conservative leverage ratios.
In the third quarter, we completed approximately $21 million of acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date value to $109 million, already
achieving our target set at the beginning of the year.
As we discussed last quarter, we have been seeing the market slowly adjust to macro concerns as cap rates try to find higher footing to
close the gap between buyers and sellers.
In the third quarter, we targeted higher cap rate transaction, which impacted volume relative to prior quarters. This will likely continue
into the fourth quarter and we remain well positioned to capitalize on attractive opportunities as they emerge. We are the largest owner,
manager and consolidator of the Postal Service's Irreplaceable Logistics Network. However, we are still in the early innings of our growth
story and have plenty of runway ahead.
Our management team has over 30 years of cycle-tested experience and a strong network of relationships built over time, which we
believe are meaningful differentiators. We are encouraged by both our internal and external growth initiatives and will continue to be
prudent stewards of capital and deploy it in accretive and appropriate manner to drive growth in this dynamic environment.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy to discuss our operating metrics.
 
Jeremy Garber
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Thank you, Andrew. As we like to remind our investors, our tenant has historically made all of its rent payments on time throughout all
economic environment. Consistent with quarters past, we collected 100% of our rents in the third quarter. This predictability of cash flow
is a significant differentiator for Postal Realty.
In the third quarter of 2022, we produced a 29% increase in rental income from the third quarter of 2021, reflecting a strong existing
portfolio, as well as contributions from the accretive acquisitions made over the last 12 months.
We have maintained a 98.8% historical weighted average lease retention rate over the past 10-plus years, which reflects the strategic
importance of these properties to both the Postal Service and the communities they serve. This high rate continues to validate our due
diligence process in identifying locations that are vital to the Postal Service. Year to date, we have not received any notices of termination
by the Postal Service.
In the third quarter of 2022, we acquired 66 properties for approximately $21 million, excluding closing costs. These acquisitions added
170,000 net leasable interior square feet to our portfolio, inclusive of 61,000 square feet from 41 last mile properties and 109,000 square
feet from 25 flex properties. Subsequent to quarter end, and through October 26, we have acquired seven properties for $5.9 million and
placed an additional 10 properties, $4 million on these definitive contracts.
I'll now turn the call over to Rob to discuss our third-quarter 2022 financial results.
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
Thank you, Jeremy, and thank you, everyone for joining us on today's call. Touching upon what both Andrew and Jeremy discussed, we
are pleased to deliver the results of another productive quarter as we remain well positioned to capitalize on external growth
opportunities.
For the third quarter, we delivered funds from operations or FFO of $0.25 per diluted share and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO
of $0.26 per diluted share. We have maintained a conservative balance sheet and as of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $189
million of gross debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.63% and only $31 million of floating rate debt outstanding on our
revolver.
Inclusive of all interest rate hedges, approximately 84% of our debt was at a fixed rate and our weighted average maturity was 5.4 years.
As Andrew highlighted earlier on the call, we have no notable debt maturities until 2026.
Our liquidity position is strong with $119 million undrawn on our revolver, $225 million of accordions on our facilities and approximately
$5 million of cash. For the third quarter 2022, net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.3 times and net debt to enterprise value
was 34.6%, well below our leverage targets of 7 times and 40%, respectively.
Recurring CapEx for the third quarter was under $0.04 per square foot and based on timing of projects, we anticipate it will be closer to
$0.06 per square foot in future quarters as we continue to invest in our assets.
Cash G&A in Q3 came in below our prior guidance due to cost savings as well as intentionally spreading out some costs into 2023. Our
guidance still remains that cash G&A as a percentage of revenues will continue to decline on an annual basis and we believe Q3 is a good
run rate for Q4.
Our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.235, which annualizes to $0.94 per share, a 4.4%
increase from the third-quarter 2021 dividend. This continues our history of increasing the dividend every quarter since IPO.
We believe Postal Realty is uniquely positioned for resilience through economic climates, and therefore, we remain confident in our
ability to execute our strategy. Our conservative balance sheet, market-tested and experienced management team, predictable cash
flows, and a history of 100% rent collections provide a steadfast foundation that will allow us to continue to deliver value for our
stakeholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Rob Stevenson, Janney.
 
Rob Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst
Good morning, guys. Across all real estate asset class, it seems like the smaller investors have been the last to realize that prices have
changed, and unless facing some sort of event seem to have pulled the assets back from the market waiting for debt and everything else
to stabilize.
You know, given that there's a bunch of smaller players in your business, how are you guys seeing the transaction market today in terms
of availability of assets out there relative to past quarters as well as ability to -- for the sellers to be reasonable in terms of market
pricing?
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Hey, Rob. Yes, so as everybody knows, we're kind of living through a very strange time. The assets are available, we're just not seeing
sellers change their expectations for where pricing is supposed to be today relative to where it was a couple of months ago. And so, we
are patiently walking the sellers up, trying to get cap rates to where we want to execute on them.
You know, the good news is that we've always bought a different range of different asset types and asset sizes. And we've always stated
that that the range of cap rates in our asset class is wide. And so, thankfully, we have the ability to execute at the higher end of our
range, which is what we've been trying to do.
 
Rob Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst
Okay. And then, recent conversations with the Postal Service, how willing are they and their representatives to acknowledge the
inflationary environment and the need for potentially higher rent increases on renewals going forward?
 
Jeremy Garber
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Yeah. Hey, Rob. It's Jeremy. So we continue to have productive discussions with the USPS on our 68 leases that are expiring in 2022. And
as we shared in prior calls, you know, we've been focused on introducing a new concept of an inflationary adjustment. We're confident
we'll achieve a result that will allow us to continue to deliver our annual NOI growth of 2% to 3%.
 
Rob Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst
Okay. And then last one for me, Rob, where is your best source of financing today when you look forward? If you know there's a portfolio
that comes to market that you guys want to bid on, et cetera, where are you seeing the best debt availability and pricing for you guys
today?
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
Hey, Rob. So it's -- I think it's a mix of everything, you know. We're fortunate to have access to capital in multiple ways in the equity
markets, you know, through an ATM when active through regular common offerings, and then through operating partnership units. And
on the debt side, you know, our credit facility is at a good spread, a good rate, has a lot of availability and we can turn things out when
the swap rates are attractive or we can keep afloat when we want.
But as you know, we've really tried to maintain a balance sheet that's higher proportion of fixed rate to be conservative. So, I feel like
we've got access across the board. And as you know, the market is super dynamic. So rates move up and down a lot (technical difficulty)
and so does our share price and so does our pipeline. So you know, it's really a day-to-day game and we're lucky to have access to all
these sources.
 
Rob Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC - Analyst
Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Thank you.
 
Operator
Tony Paolone, JPMorgan.
 
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, guys. You have [Novim] on the line for Tony this morning. I guess on my first question, I'm just a little curious if you could
speak on acquisitions and I guess current market conditions. If you guys have seen buyers are less willing to maybe accept OP units,
rather opting to trade rather just for cash instead?
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Appreciate the question. So, we actually see sellers still very interested in the operating partnership unit currency. We haven't been very
proactive in using that currency over the past quarter, just given where our stock price was trading, but the interest in the currency is still
very much there.
 
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. Okay, thanks. And I guess, given where inflation is, should we expect maybe a drag from the operating expenses the company is
responsible for on your properties?
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
It's a good question. And you know, look, it's something everybody's facing, whether it's with CapEx or operating expenses. But you know,
because of the short-term duration of our leases, we do have the ability to mark those rents to market, which overcomes the operating
expense increases. So net-net, I don't see it being a drag, but it's definitely more challenging than it was in prior years.
 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Thank you.
 
Operator
John Kim, BMO.
 
John Kim
BMO Capital Markets - Analyst
Thanks. Good morning. Year to date, you've so far stayed away from acquisitions in industrial. I was wondering if you could talk about
pricing? Has it helped, you know, more [studying] industrial lower cap rates versus the other two asset types that you look at?
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Yes. So in the current environment, we really haven't been focused on the industrial assets. The market for those assets has been pretty
frothy. And even though the cap rates on some of the deals that we have looked at in that particular asset class have moved, they're still
at the lower end of the range, if not below our range. And in the current environment, those are not deals that we're looking to do.
Thankfully, we've exceeded our target for the year and we're really not looking to do deals, unless it's priced right and unless we believe
that it's a good fit for our portfolio in the current environment.
 
John Kim
BMO Capital Markets - Analyst
In this current environment, are portfolio premiums still there or are performance trading now on par with individual asset sales or even
potentially at a discount?
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
So, in general, the larger owners or the most -- more sophisticated sellers or the owners of larger assets are at least we've seen less
willing to adjust to the current environment. So those assets and those portfolios are typically trading at the lower end of our range.
 
John Kim
BMO Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. And my final question, [and I know you've talked about it a couple different times] , but on this impact of inflation, I guess you were
saying that you were talking about some kind of inflation adjustment potential in lease renewals coming up but also maintain your 2% to
3% organic growth. I was just wondering if there was a potential for there to be upside in that rental number to more than offset
inflationary pressures on the expense side?
 
Jeremy Garber
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - President
You know, as we go through our lease renewals, we spend time reviewing markets and comps and trying to achieve on a lease rate rates
that allow us to overcome the current environment. The inflationary adjustment is just an additional element that we're trying to
introduce here, just given how things have really ramped up over the past, you know, call it, year and a half.
So that's why we're confident we're going to achieve an adjustment over market rents, which will allow us, as I described, to continue to
deliver the NOI growth that we've historically delivered.
 
John Kim
BMO Capital Markets - Analyst
And would that be CPI based on local geography? Or would it be capped? Just want to know if there is any more details you can share?
 
Jeremy Garber
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Yes. At the moment, that conversation with USPS is live. We haven't agreed on how the adjustment is going to work. So I don't have any
more information to give you at the moment.
 
John Kim
BMO Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. Thank you very much.
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Thank you.
 
Operator
Barry Oxford, Colliers.
 
Barry Oxford
Colliers Securities LLC - Analyst
Great. I know you guys don't want to give too much more information on the inflation adjustment leases, but typically, doesn't the
government want kind of a flat rate for five years? And so, if you were to have an inflationary adjustment, do you think that that rate
might move year to year? Or would you do some sort of kind of blended rate so it would be fixed for five years?
 
Jeremy Garber
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - President
Yeah, again, Barry, it's Jeremy. You're right. Historically, these have been five-year flat leases. You know, I think we're probably going to
achieve a similar outcome with that adjustment embedded. But again, we haven't concluded the conversations and they continue to be
fluid. So as soon as we have a definitive agreement, we will share that.
 
Barry Oxford
Colliers Securities LLC - Analyst
Okay. Great, great. And another quick question on the G&A line item, as far as how we should think about that. G&A was a little lower --
not a lot lower, but a little lower here in 3Q versus 2Q. How should we think ex non-cash comp? How should we think about G&A going
forward into '23?
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
Barry, good question. And I think I alluded to it in the prepared remarks that we believe that Q3 is a good run rate for Q4 in that respect.
But I think your question is more about kind of how does this roll forward?
 
Barry Oxford
Colliers Securities LLC - Analyst
Right. Correct.
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
You know, earlier this year -- yes. So earlier this year we've given some guidance that our cash G&A was projected to increase by $2
million, $2.5 million. Based on where we reported and based on that guidance I'd given, the new projection's probably closer to an
increase of $1.5 million over last year. That puts us $500,000 to $1 million lighter than our initial guidance earlier this year for 2022. And
some of that's due to reduction of expenses in '22. But most of it's really projected to be spent throughout 2023 as long as the
environment is conducive to it.
 
Barry Oxford
Colliers Securities LLC - Analyst
Got it. Okay, thanks for that color. That's all I have, guys.
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
Thanks. Thanks, Barry.
 
Barry Oxford
Colliers Securities LLC - Analyst
Yes.
 
Operator
Jon Petersen, Jefferies.
 
Jon Petersen
Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst
Great, thank you. I think, Rob, earlier you were asked about, you know, potential sources of capital and you mentioned the ATM, when
that's open to you. So, maybe if we could talk about that from two different angles. Like you know, at today's market pricing, like, what is
the stock price -- what kind of stock price do you have to see where equity or ATM issuance makes sense to do acquisitions? Or maybe
looking at it the opposite way, you know, where do cap rates need to move to, to make today's stock price make sense in terms of new
ATM issuance?
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
Yes. As you know, we always want our stock price to be higher. And the higher, the more attractive. But we - it's a content analysis we do
of where a pipeline is. And when we issue equity, when we use debt, we're looking for it to be accretive to our acquisition pipeline and the
use of capital.
And so it's dynamic. But even at today's prices and the guidance that Andrew has given for kind of where cap rates are and where we've
executed, we can still do acquisitions in an accretive manner.
 
Jon Petersen
Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst
Okay, got it. And then, maybe if I could just -- on the G&A, I think Rob, in your prepared remarks you mentioned you spread some G&A
costs into 2023. Can you give us just some more details on what some of those costs were that you spread into '23?
 
Robert Klein
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CFO
You know, earlier this year, we had talked about, you know, some of the increase this year being related to some projects internally:
infrastructure, IT, some hires, et cetera. It's a little bit of all of that that gets pushed to next year; it's a blend of that. And some of these
projects that we're using to harness information and to really improve ourselves internally, we've done some of that this year and there's
some of it that we're planning to do next year.
 
Jon Petersen
Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst
Okay. All right, that's great. Thank you so much.
 
Andrew Spodek
Postal Realty Trust, Inc. - CEO
