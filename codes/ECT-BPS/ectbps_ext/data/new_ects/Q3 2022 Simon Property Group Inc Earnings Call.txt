David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Good morning, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter results. Third quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.97 per
share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.04 from a mark-to-market in fair value publicly held securities.
Let me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter,
and contributed $0.05 of growth driven by higher rental income. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter, and
increased $0.05 despite the negative currency impact of $0.05, given the strength in the dollar.
These positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs
associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok integration cost and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from
our 2 value-oriented brands.
Domestic property net operating income increased 2.3% for the quarter and 4.4% for the first 9 months of the year. NOI growth for the
quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the write-off of outstanding receivables from Regal theaters
upon its bankruptcy filing. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, at constant currency grew 3.2% for the quarter and
5.5% for the first 9 months of the year.
Occupancy ended third quarter, 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points
compared to the second quarter. TRG was 94.5%. Average base minimum rent increased for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80,
an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued. We signed nearly 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in
the quarter and have signed over 3,100 leases for more than 10 million square feet through the first 9 months of the year, and we
continue to have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. The opening rate on our new leases has increased 10% since last year,
roughly $6 per lease.
Reported retail sales momentum continued. Our shopper remains resilient. We reported another record in the third quarter of $749 per
square foot for the malls and outlets, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15%
increase. TRG was $1,080 per foot, a 25% increase. Our occupancy cost is at 12%, which is a level not seen since early 2015.
We opened our tenth premium outlet in Japan and started construction on a significant expansion at Busan in South Korea. Our
redevelopment pipeline is moving forward with more accretive projects. Turning to our other platform investments in the third quarter
contributed $0.17 in FFO per share as compared to $0.28 in the prior year period after cash distributions received. We have
approximately $475 million of net investment within our other platform investments, primarily in ABG and RGG.
We expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI. That is, for those of you like math is a 60% return on investment. We
believe the value of our investments in OPI is over $2 billion. We recently announced our strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global
real estate investment and management firm. We see great opportunity with this investment to capitalize on the growing asset and
investment management businesses. The Jamestown team, our experienced, mixed-use operators, developers, property managers and
asset managers were pleased to expand our investment platform with this best-in-class operator, and we expect to grow their asset
management business and accelerate our densification opportunities. We anticipate this accretive transaction to close prior to the end of
this year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing 16 property mortgages during the first 9 months of the year for a total of
$1.8 billion at an average interest rate of 4.78%. Our balance sheet is strong, with approximately $8.6 billion of liquidity. Net debt to
EBITDA is at 5.7x and our fixed charge coverage is over 5x. Today, we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we
will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter. The dividend is payable on December 30. Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares
of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share.
Given our current view for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77
per share to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share compared to $11.44 last year. So that's an increase of 13% at the bottom end of the range
and $0.12 at the midpoint and an increase of $0.26 at the midpoint compared to our initial guidance for the year. This guidance increase
comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.
Now just let me conclude by saying we had another impressive quarter. And before we get to questions, I would like to share some
thoughts with you for nearly 30 years as a public company, like many companies and industries, we have dealt with significant shifts
within our industry. In our case, we embrace these challenges and our better operators and more thoughtful and astute capital allocation
-- allocators. Many have tried to kill off physical retail real estate and in particular, in closed malls, and I need not remind you, when
physical retail was closed in COVID, all the naysayers saying that physical retail was gone forever.
However, brick and mortar is strong -- the brick-and-mortar retailer is strong and e-commerce is flatlining. And importantly, over this
period of time, we have paid out $39 billion in dividends to shareholders as we have become stronger and more profitable. And why do I
bring this up constantly? Well, because hopefully, this will put in into the so-called negative mall narrative, as you can't pay those
dividends without a strong underlying business.
Now operator, we're ready for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
It's nice to see the occupancy continue to climb and I know minimum base rents are up 1.7%. And you did mention in your comments that
new lease rates were up 6% -- or $6 sorry, per foot. Can you just kind of provide any color on how leasing spreads are trending? And do
you envision bringing that metric back perhaps early next year. Just any thoughts around that?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Yes, they are -- when you do comparable space, they're wildly positive.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Can you just provide any more color?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, I just -- we don't report spreads, but they're wildly positive when you focus on comparable space.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
David. one, appreciate the continued disclosure of the different platforms, the core, the international Klepierre and the brands. But my
question is, just given continued inflation, obviously, energy growing more of a concern. Can you just help us understand when we here
see like retailer brand earning contribution is down or we read about different retailers having issues, how that translates, if at all, to
their leasing? Because I think 1 of the questions that certainly comes up is, hey, retailers have a bad print, Oh, that's negative for the
landlords, but that doesn't seem to be the case of accepting maybe certain circumstances.
So is there a general insight that you can help us understand that when the retailers have a bad quarter or a bad print, what the impact,
if at all, that you see on the leasing side?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Sure. I would say this is something we monitor every single day in good times, bad times, mediocre times. We have yet to see any
pullback in opening new stores or renewals. So there's been absolutely no impact. And you're always going to have a deal here or there
that falls apart for all sorts of different reasons, but nothing based upon the macro conditions. And I would tell you, Alex, that where
they're seeing most of the pressure is in the e-commerce business.
So the flight towards bricks and mortar is real. It's going to be sustained. And if they're in the retail business, and they want to grow,
they're going to open stores. And it's that simple because the returns on e-commerce just aren't quite what everybody talked about. And
so I think you've seen that, and we've seen no slowdown whatsoever. There's always going to be a deal here or there, but if they're a
growing retailer, they have to put the money in bricks, highest return on investment.
We understand it as well as anybody because we see the e-commerce business not just in the brands that we own with ABG, but also
Penny and RGG, and it's been a difficult year for e-commerce and bricks is where the action is.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Dave, you've been doing this a long time.
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
You are right about that.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
But how do you and the team feel headed into holiday? The consumer seems okay, but certainly, we're facing a slowdown, high inflation,
it's hitting interest rates. So I mean what really keeps you optimistic on your retail investments? And then also on the holiday overall and
it being a solid season?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, look, you're always -- as any kind of CEO, you're always worried about the macro, the macro environment. But I will tell you what
gives me unbelievable confidence going into the next few years is the realization that what we have been saying is that don't
underestimate physical retail. And it's kind of repetitive what I said earlier, but I'll just reinforce, we feel really good because physical
retail is where the action is. That's where the return on investment is -- and so even though if we may slow down next year or even into
the holiday season, I don't think the growth from our existing business is going to slow down because the demand for new deals and
space is there.
On the retail side, we're trying to -- 1 is, I don't want to make a huge deal out of it. Two is I want people to understand, we've made an
unbelievable investment. So we're getting a 50% return on our net investment there. So if it goes to 70% or it goes to 50%, it's -- we are
going to have volatility, but it's still the hell of an investment, still being a great thing for us to do. to not only understand but what it
takes for retailers to be successful, but kind of where the future is. So there will be volatility in that, but our are better brands in there like
Brooks Brothers, Lucky Jeans, [Monica], really doing well.
I said to you on the last call, the lower -- the lower income consumer is tightened their belt and we do have a few brands that are affected
by that. But even with that said, we have an unbelievable return on investment after tax from the earnings that those businesses throw
off. And we're also making investments in that -- in those businesses. So I expect those investments to pay for future earnings growth.
But the macro is concerning, but look, rates will have an impact is probably the most direct impact that we'll have next year. But I still
feel like demand and bricks and mortars where the action is going to be.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.
 
Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Quick ones, if I could sneak them in. The first is just on the occupancy gain, pretty impressive this quarter. I think you talked about maybe
getting to pre-COVID occupancy by 2023. Just how are you thinking about sort of the upside on occupancy in this portfolio at this point?
The second 1 was just on the new disclosure in the supplemental is really helpful on the fixed versus variable. Just any color or any
comments as you're converting these variable leases to fix? How is that going? How much is left to go? What's the economics look like?
Would be helpful.
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Sure. Let me -- I'll take the last one. I mean, we expect to garner a lot of the percentage and overage rent to minimum rent as these
leases roll, but they take time to roll over. And our average lease term is probably 7 years. So it's not going to happen overnight, but it
will happen over time. And remind me your first question?
Occupancy. Thank you. So Look, I think we're still on track to achieve our goal -- I mean, I -- frankly, I think we've done an unbelievable
job in increasing our occupancy and increasing our cash flow since the shutdowns. So hopefully, in '23, we'll get back to pre-COVID
levels.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street.
 
Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst of Retail and Industrial
Could you elaborate on how you expect to grow Jamestown's asset management business? And could you see that platform being
acquisition vehicles, U.S. malls or Simon's the operating partner and how minority stake in the fund or investment?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
It's really in the asset management business. So I don't see it buying -- I don't see -- I don't see buying malls in that platform under any
circumstance. But they have a lot of institutional relationships as do we, and we think working together, we'll be able to get separate
account money to invest in kind of the opportunities that exist in real estate. They're great place-making real estate. So there'll be some
of those opportunities. They are also historically a big German fund operator. We expect them to continue that and they look for
opportunities both internationally and domestically, not in our core business, but in other forms of real estate.
So I think between essentially kind of the historical separate account business. They have their premier fund, plus their German fund
business and then our adding to that platform in terms of owning 50% of the business. I think it will be attractive for institutional and
retail investors, not retail real estate investors, but retail investors to potentially want to have Jamestown invest in real estate form.

Next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
David, I was heartening to hear you talk about the benefits of physical real estate over e-commerce, your perspective is always much
valued on those. You have better insight call on that than anybody in the industry. And obviously, sales records, tenant sales records,
leasing remains strong. I guess the question I have for you is, last quarter, I think you said your [SNO] pipeline was around 200 basis
points. Is that still the case? Because you're signing new leases as well as opening stores? And then when do you think you're going to be
able to achieve 19 levels of NOI on a same-store basis.
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, look, I -- we're pushing the group to achieve that next year, okay? And Floris, I would say to you the biggest issue for us next year
will be just getting our pipeline open. And a lot of these are really good retailers with really good stores, and it takes time to build them
and open them. So that will be our challenge. That will be our primary challenge to reach next year's -- to get back to '19 levels. But I'm
hopeful that we can do it, and we are pushing very hard to do that, which is, I think, pretty much ahead of schedule. It's a very fair and
good question to ask that because I ask that every single day. So you and I are on the same page. On the pipe.
 
Brian J. McDade
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Floris, this is Brian. We're still running about 200 basis points. We've added stuff and we've taken stuff out as we opened, but we're
running around 200 basis points consistently.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
In the malls and the outlets relatively unchanged?
 
Brian J. McDade
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Very consistent.
 
Operator
Next question is from Craig Mailman of Citi.
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
This is Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just on the Jamestown strategic partnership. What was the price and valuation for the deal? And
then do you expect to move more into asset management? And if so, how large could that platform become?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
The first part was what -- how big would the -- what I'm not sure. When did you -- you broke up there -- can you repeat your question?
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
For the Jamestown deal.
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Yes -- we're not disclosing the private company, and we both chose not to disclose it. So I think you asked the size of the deal. I'm sorry,
Craig, you're breaking up some. I'm guessing that's what you've asked. They manage roughly $13 billion of assets across their various
funds. And we are hopeful that over time, it's not just quantity, but there is quality involved, but there's no reason why we can't turn that
into 1 of the bigger asset management players with their expertise and our expertise combined, their reputation and our reputation
combined, we think it will be an attractive platform to raise additional funds to invest in real estate.
And I am hopeful that we can more than double it. I'm not going to put a number out there, but we didn't do it to be flat. We did it
because we expect to grow their assets under management. And given the existing size, we think we can grow it with time pretty
significantly.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
David, on your comment about wildly positive leasing spreads, I guess, how recent of a dynamic is that where you would, I guess,
describe them as being wildly positive.
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
I would say it really started at the beginning of this year. So look, we -- again, spreads -- ultimately, you see it in our minimum base rent
growth, right? So -- but that's a huge -- that's everything. So it takes time. But if you -- and again, we want you to focus on cash flow
growth as opposed to spreads. But if we were to track comparable space, space leases to same space, it would be wildly positive, more
than the $6 per foot that I mentioned but we don't then we don't want you to like be obsessed with that either.
So we're trying just to focus everyone on occupancy, minimum rent growth, we've outlined kind of where we get the variable income
where we get our contractual income. It's all in the 8-K, and it all manifests itself in the NOI. And that's what we want you to focus on.
But if you were to take the subset, which is space for space that's like it's pretty damn impressive. And our renewals are positive overall.
And so that's changed. That you're right, over the last certainly in COVID we got -- those renewals were tough that happened to show up
during COVID. But I am happy to report renewals generally, and new deals with ending space and new space is wildly positive and that's
manifesting itself in our comp NOI growth. Then you add that to the pipeline, and that's why we feel good about next year.
But unfortunately, the only negative next year will be getting stores open and getting this 200 basis point type open and operate. And
that takes time because the retailers that we're doing business with want to have the proper looking, they want to have a proper look in
store. But we are very pleased to see the spread story change.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Great. Will Simon's total investment in redevelopments and developments grow in 2023 or might macro events like a potential recession
cause a pause in new projects?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Yes. That's a good question, Craig. Right now, we think the -- if we do run into a recession, actually, from the standpoint of new projects,
actually, we see a slight benefit. They sound counterintuitive, but construction pricing for new projects is higher than what we want to
see. So I'm hopeful that any slowdown will demonstrate, will reduce cost of new construction, which we will then want to like move
forward more aggressively. So it's kind of counterintuitive. But again, I'm not looking forward. I don't want a recession. I hope there's not
a recession, but from the standpoint of redevelopment and new development, we actually counter the countercyclicality of cost of
construction may actually be one of the side benefits that we can take advantage of.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
I was just looking at the lease income disclosed in the supplemental for the consolidated properties. And it seems like that was up 60
basis points year-over-year, but your domestic NOI was up 2.3%. So I'm just -- and at the same time, it was -- at least income was down
modestly sequentially. So just talking for a little bit more of an explanation, I guess, or tying to lose end as to the difference between the
lease income and then the NOI reported? And is it cost controls or any other kind of unusual items that kind of drove that disparity
between the lease income growth (inaudible) NOI?
 
Brian J. McDade
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. I think you had less -- we had a reduction in overage rent, right, would be 1 of the reasons. Reduction overage rent, Juan, don't
forget, we mentioned that we took a charge for the legal write-off and to reduce that line item as well in the current quarter. And then we
do have certainly cost containment, as you can see through the P&L. So all of that mixed together drove the levers to higher NOI growth.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
If you could just please touch on the reduction in overage rent again and how much of that is driven by, one, reduced sales despite kind of
tenant sales being up 14% year-over-year? And then otherwise, the conversion of pandemic leases back to fixed and then maybe how
much more of that kind of conversion we expect to see this year and into next year?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, we -- look, I mean strategy-wise, we always try to convert our overage rent into minimum rent. So you -- certainly, some reduction is
associated with it. And then usually '21, obviously, on sales was pretty strong. And in certain cases, percent rent where we -- it's not so
much the overage say, the percent of rent, we have some tenants that are just purely percent rent.
They've had slower sales since '21, and that's showing up in the numbers. But -- we're still very pleased with the results. So I think those
are kind of the big picture. We'll continue to reduce percent in overage rent as leases roll over. On the other hand, our sales are rising and
the retailers focused on the higher-income consumer continue to spend, and that's good for us as it shows up in our cash flow.
 
Operator
Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
The domestic property NOI increased 2.3% in the quarter. The portfolio increased 3.2%. That's a deceleration from last quarter about
130, 140 basis points, but it sounds like there's an offset of 100 basis points from the Regal write-off. So maybe like a 30 to 40 basis point
slowdown. So from the last quarter, so I guess -- the question is, is this like the right rate of portfolio NOI growth that we should expect
kind of going forward? Or is there an expectation that things kind of continue to moderate from here?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, again, I wouldn't focus too much on quarter-over-quarter. There is volatility in our numbers because of overage rent and other
factors, lied off like regal, which is highly unusual that it would manifest itself in a material number, but it's important to point out. So
look, I think you have to go back to the beginning of the year where we thought because '21 was a really banner year, and we were very
conservative in our comp NOI estimate of 2%.
We're blowing through that number. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. But it's -- our comp NOI growth is going to be really
strong, and we continue to expect it to grow next year as well. So you've got to look at this over 2- or 3-year period as opposed to
quarter-over-quarter or even year-over-year. And we're making a tremendous amount of progress, a number we were 1 of the few
industries that were literally mandated the shutdown, and we're kind of back up and running and producing results that are
pre-pandemic, which is very good to see.
And we'll expect to see comp NOI growth next year even in the face of a potential recession.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
In terms of the write-off from Regal, is this for all your Regals? And are they rent reductions or rejected leases?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
This is all of our Regal. We took a reserve against outstanding receivables.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
So what would happen, it's still going to operate as Regal or ...
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, we don't know. I mean they are in bankruptcy, we -- my guess is they'll come out of bankruptcy as it's an ongoing business, but we
have to wait and see. I'm sure they're going to restructure the debt. We're experts in understanding bankruptcies, but I would imagine
they'll reward and some of this may come back as it's pre-petitioned. So in order for them to assume a lease. They have to clear up to the
pre-petition rent. So it gets very technical and complicated. There's trade-offs, we'll just have to see how it goes through bankruptcy at
this point.
And -- but I expect them to continue to operate. There could be a couple of theater closures in our portfolio. Some of that will be fine.
And -- but we have yet to have a -- I think their debt and financing is, I think, just about approved or was approved. So it's going to go
through a process that we've -- we have seen hundreds of times.

Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist Securities.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
So just want to go back to your comments about the lease spreads looking pretty positive this quarter. If you take a step back to look at
and look at it on a kind of net economic basis, meaning regardless of is it minimum rent or income from percentage deals, as you're
signing new deals, how does the net economic benefit look like versus the comments you made about the lease spread looking positive?
And what do you think that looks like going forward?
 
Thomas Ward
Simon Property Group, Inc. - SVP of IR
Ki Bin, can you repeat your question, you were breaking up a little bit.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Sure. Yes. It was really talk about spreads. Yes. Is this better?
 
Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD, Head of the US Real Estate & Lodging Research and Senior Real
Estate Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Yes.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Yes. So just talking about the lease spreads, you guys mentioned that the spreads were pretty positive this quarter. I'm just curious about
the net economic impact of the renewals for new leases meaning as you convert some of the percentage deals into fixed, is the net
economic benefit you're getting as good as the comments you made about spreads looking pretty positive?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, sure. I mean it's -- yes, because we obviously take into account our existing income stream from that space, which includes if we
have overage of percent rent. And we're -- we look at it in totality but we expect the total income stream to go up. And coding tends to be
minimum rent increase and some assumption on overage. That's why rent spreads are kind of whatever you -- whatever you want it to be,
okay? That's why we chose not to do it. So as an example, our -- when we disclosed it historically, we included everything. We had
minimum rent against minimum rent. We did not factor in overage.
Well, Taubman as an example, when they did their rent spreads, they included some assumption on overage. Well, when they disclosed
it to their rent spreads, is that beneficial or not beneficial. I mean, to the -- so to me, it's like, hey, it all shows up in cash flow man, so you
see the cash flow, see the NOI. So that's why you guys be very careful with rent spreads. That's why they're more manufactured than they
should be. They're, in some cases, take assumptions and whether you want assumptions or not, we'd rather not have assumptions. So we
just say here's the math.
Minimum right, you see our overage, see the NOI next question. So -- but when we look at our -- when we go lease -- space by space.
We're looking at the total income stream before and after the renewal or in the case of a new tenant to see whether we're going up or
down or it's flat. And what I'm telling you is the trend is up pretty straightforwardly.
 
Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. Great. And you guys mentioned that the lease percentage for your portfolio is about 200 basis points higher than that [94.5%]. I'm
just curious if you look at the forward leasing pipeline of new deals that you're looking at as we head into next year, what does that
picture look like compared to maybe a couple of quarters ago? And tied to that, I also noticed your 2023 lease expirations didn't really
budge all that much quarter-over-quarter. Just like any kind of preliminary thoughts on that role?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Yes. The stuff out there, we're very close to some of the larger accounts, just takes time to do renewals, paper and and all that stuff. So
that's all moving not -- no real concerns there. Go ahead Brian.
 
Brian J. McDade
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
And Ki Bin, you said there about the 200 basis points. Let me just clarify. That is included within the current occupancy level. leasing that
has been done but hasn't commenced paying rent. So that is next year effectively will be partially next year's growth.

Our last question is from Handel St. Juste of Mizuho.

I have a question, a follow-up for you on the leasing. The occupancy is up 170 basis points year-over-year, but your lease income is only
up about 60 basis points. My question is, when are we going to see the impact of that occupancy gain. Is that part of the cautious
optimism embedded in your thinking for next year and your hopes for getting back to 2019 levels or that be more of a full year '24
impact?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Well, I think you've seen it, and you'll continue to see it. So our comp NOI growth the first 9 months is 4.4%. So you've seen it for the first
9 months, 4.4% growth. And then as Brian mentioned earlier, and I have mentioned throughout the call, is we had this other pipeline
that's basically leases that will open and start paying commencing rent in 2023. And that's why we're positive about the feeling that we'll
continue to have future comp NOI growth for next year, even in the face of potential recessionary environment, okay?
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Fair enough. And I guess as a follow-on to that, if we assume expenses have to go up given what's going on with inflation and operating
expenses, personnel, is it your expectation that you can grow NOI between the fourth quarter year and middle of next year?
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
Absolutely. That's what I -- yes, we said we expect comp NOI growth next year. And obviously, that includes the expense side as well.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research

Right, right. I was thinking more than 6 months. But none of that, 1 more if I could squeeze in for Brian. Maybe it's a bit far off, but the
$600 million of unsecured maturing next June, bearing interest at 2 and 3 quarters. What's the early thinking there? And where do you
think you could issue 10-year unsecured today?
 
Brian J. McDade
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Sure. Look, we actively monitor markets at all times, and you've seen us numerous times react ahead of maturities or at maturity. So we
would expect to continue to keep our pulse on the finger of the market. Unsecured today is approximately 6% for us.
 
David E. Simon
Simon Property Group, Inc. - Chairman, CEO & President
All right. Sneak in a few extra questions there.
I think that was it on the question side. So thank you. It's a change of pace to it in the morning, but we did it in hopes that you got home
early enough to trick or treat. And hopefully, you had a great Halloween. So thank you, and we'll talk to you soon.
