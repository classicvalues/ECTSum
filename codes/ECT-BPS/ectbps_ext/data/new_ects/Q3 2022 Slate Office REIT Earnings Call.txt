PRESENTATION
 
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Slate Office REIT's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call.
(Operator Instructions)
This call is being recorded Wednesday, November 2, 2022.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Wolanski, Senior Vice President of National Sales and Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
 
Paul Wolanski
Slate Grocery REIT - SVP of National Sales & IR
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Q3 2022 Conference Call for Slate Office REIT. I'm joined this
morning by Steve Hodgson, Chief Executive Officer; and Charles Peach, Chief Financial Officer.
Before getting started, I would like to remind participants that our discussions today may contain forward-looking statements, and
therefore we ask you to review the disclaimers regarding forward-looking statements as well as non-IFRS measures, both of which can
be found in management's discussion and analysis. You can visit Slate Office REIT's website to access all of the REIT's financial
disclosure, including our Q3 2022 investor update, which is now available.
I will now hand over the call to Steve Hodgson for opening remarks.
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. In the face of sectoral headwinds, including a rapid rise in interest rates not seen in many
years, Slate Office REIT continues to demonstrate its resilience, offering unitholders a stable and attractive distribution yield, trading
upside to its well-supported net asset value and a best-in-class management platform. Our conviction in the office sector remains
strong. We know that physical workspace enables collaboration, culture and innovation.
At the same time, we understand that in a post-pandemic era, certain tenants and industries will be more significant users of office space
than others. As such, we will continue to position our portfolio to focus on opportunities that align with tenant demand. We believe
well-located, high-quality and modern office buildings with growing strong credit tenants will continue to outperform.
The REIT's investment activity during and subsequent to the quarter is a great example of portfolio repositioning. We disposed at a very
attractive price, an older property in Toronto that has tenant and capital risk, and we purchased a higher-yielding newer asset in Chicago
anchored by a long-term lease with Pfizer, which also has further upside on occupancy. This type of transaction enhances the REIT's
ability to provide stable performance.
Notwithstanding the REIT's attractive assets and longer-term upside, our Board of Trustees recognizes that market disruptions related to
the pandemic and elevated levels of inflation continue to weigh on the valuations of publicly traded REITs, creating a divergence
between asset values and unit price. As a Board and management team, it is our responsibility to consider every possible opportunity to
surface value for our unitholders.
To this end, after quarter end, the Board formed a special committee of independent directors to oversee a review of strategic
alternatives for the REIT. As we continue to navigate a highly volatile macroeconomic environment, the strategic review will play a key
role in identifying additional ways to maximize value for all unitholders. All of our routine operations and investment activity will carry on
as normal during this period, and we intend to provide an update once the process is completed.
I will now hand it over to Charles for some additional highlights on the quarter.
 
Charles Edward Neville Peach
Slate Office REIT - CFO
Thank you, Steve. In the third quarter of 2022, the REIT had a distribution yield of 9.2% and has provided an AFFO payout ratio of 75.9%.
Loan to value was reduced to 58.4%, while net operating income rose by $500,000. While disposition costs reduced FFO and core FFO
from the prior 3 months, AFFO for the quarter remained at $0.13 per unit. FFO, core FFO each fell $0.02 to $0.12 and $0.13, respectively
on a per unit basis, due to dispositions costs on the mentioned before appraisal value sale of 95 and 105 Moatfield, while AFFO per unit
was $0.13, unchanged from the first quarter -- prior quarter.
Both during the quarter and subsequently, the REIT has continued to refinance its upcoming debt maturities, having extended its
Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar revolving credit facilities while reducing and extended -- extending its largest single debt facility at 120
South LaSalle. There are $12 million of refinancing remaining for 2023, which is progressing well.
I'll now hand over for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) There are no further questions. Please proceed.
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Operator, we believe that there's a queue of questions that we're seeing in the system.
 
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of [Bernie John].
 
Unidentified Analyst
So why did the AFFO per unit decrease?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Operator, I'm not sure we're seeing the same questions as you. The first question should be from Sai from Cormark Securities in the
queue.
 
Operator
Sairam Srinivas from Cormark Securities.
 
Sairam Srinivas
Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Steve, Paul, Charles. So the question I had was around the Chicago acquisition. Could you just take us through the thought process
behind the capital allocation there? And how do you guys see that fitting into the broader plan?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. I mean the Chicago acquisition, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is really in line with our strategy of repositioning the
portfolio. What we've done over the last quarter is effectively reduced our asset base, created some liquidity to pay down debt, but also
traded out of an older building that had some tenant and capital risk in Toronto at a 6.4% cap and bought an office building in Chicago
with a long-term lease with an investment-grade tenant with upside in occupancy at an 8.4% cap. And it's a relatively new building with
very little capital required in the near term. So it's just consistent with our strategy of repositioning the portfolio.
 
Sairam Srinivas
Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Thanks, Steve. So the other question I had was on vacancy and I know this quarter, we saw some of that. Is that mainly because of the
SNC lease that's expiring at -- I mean the downsizing that's happening at this month?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. There was a couple of things. The vacancy that we saw in the quarter, I'm assuming you're referring to, it's a couple of things. It is the
phased out vacancy of SNC-Lavalin at 195, the West Mall. In addition, the disposition of 95-105 Moatfield being a higher occupied
building, had impact on occupancy as well. But just as a reminder, there was a higher occupied building now, but our view was that there
was some tenant risk there. And then in addition, there was the -- mentioned, I believe, to you on the previous call, the airline industry
tenant on the West Mall property as well that vacated. So a few sort of one-off situations. But overall, we're seeing some very positive
momentum going forward and particularly in Atlantic Canada, as noted in our results.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kelcher from TD Securities.
 
Jonathan Kelcher
TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst
Just staying with, I guess, the leasing, have you guys noticed or seen any change in sort of the length of time tenants are taking to make
decisions or any slowdown in touring or anything like that?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
No, I don't think so. I think you see a little bit of that naturally in the summer quarter. But I would say it's actually the opposite of that,
Jonathan, in that we've started to see tenants commit to longer-term deals. And like the deals -- the new leasing that we did in our
portfolio had a 9.2 years of average term. So that's clearly a sign that tenants are committing long term to office space. In terms of tour
activity, I think that's where it generally slows down in the summer.
With that said, some of the vacancy that we have along the 427 that's recent and transitional, that space had not been vacant for a long
time, and we're getting some -- a lot of interest in -- from other users.
 
Jonathan Kelcher
TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst
So you've seen touring -- so touring activity slowed down in the summer, and you've seen it pick up again in the fall?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes, that's right.
 
Jonathan Kelcher
TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst
Okay. And then you had, I think, roughly 15 leases that didn't renew in the quarter. Were those -- and you talked about some, but were
the rest of those mostly spread [all out worse] than others?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. There was nothing -- there was just those 3. There was 3 that were over 5,000 square feet. The rest were spread out amongst the
portfolio and small in nature.
 
Jonathan Kelcher
TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst
Okay. And then the lease termination income you had in the quarter, was that one big one or a bunch of little ones?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
That was related to SNC.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sturges from Raymond James.
 
Bradley Sturges
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Just to follow up on the question on the lease termination fee income. Is there anything, would there be any more income you're
expecting for the rest of the year? Or would that be kind of it, after Q3?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Not anticipating any more lease termination income for the balance of the year.
 
Bradley Sturges
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And given where you are from an occupancy rate perspective, say, where do you kind of see that trending, like [the next] 2, 3
quarters?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
So we still have the last phase of SNC-Lavalin vacating in Q4, which is just over 40,000 square feet. We do have some new leases
coming online in the quarter, but I would expect occupancy to the end of the year to be relatively flat because any new leasing we've
done, even this quarter and next, won't be in occupancy until the new year, just given time to retrofit space, et cetera.
 
Bradley Sturges
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
And just on the SNC space that you got back, it sounds like you're getting good activity there. Just curious, at this point, what your time
line might be just to release that space?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Which was that, the SNC-Lavalin space?
 
Bradley Sturges
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Yes, in the West Mall.
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. So they're still -- they're going through a phased exit of that building, but we've been marketing in it. There are several larger users
that have toured. There are several sort of full floor users as well. We have some vacancy at 191 in which I think we'll get some traction on
putting the full floor tenants there. In 195 our immediate marketing strategy is try to get the larger users in there, given it is a full building
opportunity with naming rights and signage rights.
 
Bradley Sturges
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Last question, just going back to the Chicago acquisition. Maybe I missed it, but where within Chicago would that building be located?
And then can you just talk through the lease-up potential a little bit more in terms of lease prospects for leasing up the rest of the
building?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. So the location of the building is in Lake Forest. It's adjacent to a lab building that Pfizer owns. So it's very strategic for them. A lot of
the COVID vaccine lab development, R&D was done in that facility. They -- this is new space to the market. Pfizer previously occupied the
entire building. And it's a beautiful building that's probably -- it's certainly the best in that immediate area and probably the second best
in the region. Lake Forest, as you may know, is a great demographic area.
A lot of the tech and life science executives live there. So we've been quite pleased, even during due diligence we had a couple of tours for
the space. So I think our plan of having bought it at an 8.4% cap on in-place income. We put in financing as well that Charles can speak
to that allows us future funding to fund the lease-up. And if we're able to execute on that in short order, it's just an amazing real estate
transaction for us.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jenny Ma from BMO Capital Markets.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Just want to follow up on the question about the Chicago assets. For the space that is available for lease right now, is it ready to go? Or is
there any work that you need to put into it? Or any sort of specialized fit out that a potential tenant might require? Or is it a fairly short
time line to get it going when you find a new tenant?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
No. So the acquisition closed yesterday. Today, we've started work on the retrofit of the lobby. Because it was a single tenant building, we
need to retrofit the lobby to make it dual access for multi-tenant.
There's 2 wings of the building, of which one is where the vacancy is. So it actually lays out quite well for multi-tenant. And what
differentiates this building is the amenities. There's fitness facilities. It's adjacent to food and shops and [a bit of] demand. And Pfizer
doesn't have any exclusives on -- in their lease preventing us from leasing to any other life science or pharmaceutical companies. So we
expect some strong demand.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Okay. Great. I just want to ask about the Irish portfolio. It looks like there's been an improvement in the overall occupancy. But it would
appear there's a couple of assets that have occupancy below 50%. So could you remind us what the story is there and whether there's an
update on when that space could be released?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. I mean, we purchased the buildings with that vacancy, so we view that as an opportunity. The new lease that we did as well was a
20-year deal. And so at about 7,000 square feet. So we're quite pleased having executed on that. The vacancy that you're referring to is
at some pretty small buildings. So it's only going to take one tenant of each of those buildings to rectify that. And one of those in Cork, in
particular, we've had some interest and we're just working through that.
So as you can imagine, having taken over this portfolio, we've made some changes to the teams in place as well as the third-party sales
teams in place, and we're sort of relaunching it in a marketing campaign more in line with what Slate's accustomed to elsewhere.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Okay. Great. And then moving to the debt stack, could you provide what you're seeing for indicative mortgage rates for, I guess it would
be the 2023 renewals that you're looking at? And if there is -- if it's mostly concentrated in Canada or if there's any U.S. or Irish
mortgages in that mix as well, and whether or not those rates are different.
 
Charles Edward Neville Peach
Slate Office REIT - CFO
Happy to come on that. So over the period so far over the third quarter and what we've just seen as you noted in the subsequent events,
we've done over CAD 500 million equivalent of refinancing, some of which is lengthier, some of which is particularly shorter. For some of
those, we have rolled exactly the same rates that have been there before. For some of the others, we have looked at some of the slightly
higher rates that are there, too.
What we have is the benefit of some of the swaps that we have in place extend, in some instances, beyond where the refinanced debt was
refinanced at. So effectively, we've got the benefit of cheaper swaps being in place from that point on. If I look at sort of all-in rate of
where things are in next year, on the swap side of things, we're down to the 3.7 or thereabouts. At the other end of the spectrum, I think
at the highest end, we -- our projection is around the 6.5% is what we see as those maturities coming up next year.
I would say that is based on projections we see from counterparties of where we expect rates being similar. And there could be a fair
amount of movement there given the shape of the curve and just the movement we're seeing in absolute rates both from a U.S.
perspective and Canadian perspective. And I wouldn't also underestimate the fact that we have euro exposure there, too.
So on the European side of things, we have a floater outstanding at the moment. We are significantly progressed in looking at fixing that
exposure. And if we were to do so, that would reduce our floating rate exposure by over 50%.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Okay. That 6.5% that you mentioned, Charles, is that a result of spread and/or term? And is that on the Canadian or the U.S. side? It
sounds a bit high. I know we can't predict rates, but just based on what we know, still sounds a bit high.
 
Charles Edward Neville Peach
Slate Office REIT - CFO
That's on the Canadian side of things. What we see there is we have an asset where the -- it had a swap against it, that swap will no
longer -- well, essentially matures at the maturity date. So we have to take into context not only the spread component, but also where
the actually underlying rate component is as well.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Okay. Great. And then my last question is -- and I'm not sure if you can fulsomely answer this, but I'll try anyway. With regards to the
review of strategic alternatives, how long do you expect the process to take?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. Thanks, Jenny. As you mentioned, we're not really commenting specifics beyond what we said in the press release, but I can speak
more generally and provide some context. It's very clear that these market disruptions related to pandemic and elevated inflation,
continue to weigh on valuations of publicly traded REITs, particularly in the office sector, and that's created a divergence between asset
values and unit price.
So our Board has a responsibility to the REIT and all of our unitholders to consider every possible opportunity to surface value, and
they're taking action to do that. So the review, which is led by the independent trustees and supported by external financial adviser, will
provide another layer of analysis and evaluation as we look to surface value creation for the opportunities for the REIT. So they'll be
looking at a broad range of options that could include acquisitions, dispositions, corporate transactions and other partnership
opportunities.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Okay. It sounds like a fairly fulsome review then, right? So we're talking a matter of probably months?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes.
 
Jenny Ma
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Canadian Real Estate Analyst
Is that fair?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Kornack from National Bank Financial.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Just wanted to quickly follow up on Jenny's line of questioning, and I apologize if you already touched on it, but with regards to the
near-term debt maturities, is the expectation that you would get at least the amount that you have outstanding? Or are there
up-financing opportunities at this point? I just want to get a sense as to liquidity and if you'd even maybe potentially have to reduce the
size of some of those.
 
Charles Edward Neville Peach
Slate Office REIT - CFO
The fact that we have been -- that we have liquidity at the moment, and we continue to keep that liquidity, I think allows an important
amount of flexibility when it comes down to some of these debt refinancings. You will have noted that we gained an initial CAD 8 million
in financing in -- since the period end.
It's moves like that, which is on a particular asset that we owned already and financed already, which allows us flexibility when we come
around to 2 other assets in the future. If we see that there's a benefit in taking a lower leverage on an asset, in order to pay a lower
spread to that, we'd like to have that flexibility as we go forward into the next period. I think an example of our thoughts around what
might be along that is along the 120 South LaSalle, where we had 101s for 0.75 outstanding, of which we paid down 20 million with a
view that, in going forward, that should help significantly around spread availability and a number of counterparties willing to provide
financing on that asset. And I think that's an example of how we might use our liquidity and our capital to improve the cost and
availability of financing we have over the next year.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Is it possible to quantify maybe what the benefit would have been on a relative basis?
 
Charles Edward Neville Peach
Slate Office REIT - CFO
I'd rather not at the moment, because we're looking at further financing around those assets coming up within the next 4, 5 months.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Okay. No, that's perfectly fair enough. With regards to the West Mall, if someone were to take the large space, what would be your
expectations in terms of kind of signing a lease to ultimate cash payment? Does work need to be done in those spaces? Or is it in pretty
good shape for leasing?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
No, it's in very good shape. You may recall the history of that building, it was overbuilt in the Nortel days. SNC did some incremental work
to make it work for them. Most of the walls are demountable wall systems, which provides some flexibility in layout for project space, et
cetera, but also provides flexibility for future tenant use.
The building shows really well, Matt. And yes, there will be some inducements and some time required for tenants to make it their own,
but not a significant amount of time. And just as a reminder too, SNC vacated at a rent of $1,650. The starting rents that we have in the
West Mall now are $18 to $19.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And it sounds like -- I mean, if you find someone, if someone takes the space, you could potentially have them in and paying cash
rent at some point in 2023?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Yes. Yes.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then last one, -- and maybe you can provide a ballpark if it's competitive disclosure that you don't want to give. But with
regards to the recent acquisition in Chicago, what would be your hope in terms of achieving market rents at that property?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
So we think the rent that Pfizer has leased is probably at or just maybe slightly below market. So our anticipation and what we're
underwriting for the balance of the space is very similar.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
And is that sort of mid-teens, high teens...
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
It's an $18 rent, net, fully net, triple net with $0.50 escalations per year.
 
Matt Kornack
National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division - Analyst
Okay. So I mean, I guess, if you could get to 100% occupancy that's an 18% cap rate. Am I thinking of that correctly?
 
Steve Hodgson
Slate Office REIT - CEO
Certainly mid-teens. Yes.
