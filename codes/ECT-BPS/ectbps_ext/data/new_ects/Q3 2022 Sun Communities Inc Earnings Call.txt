Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results and provide an update of our full year guidance.
I would first like to share my best wishes and support for everyone affected by Hurricane Ian. The swift, organized response of our Sun
team members in the preparation and cleanup from the hurricane was remarkable and selfless.
We are pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date, and our outperformance demonstrates both the resilience of our
properties and our strength as operators. Our portfolio of best-in-class assets in high-demand locations is strategically positioned to
continue creating value for stakeholders through varying economic cycles.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results and provide an update of our full year guidance.
I would first like to share my best wishes and support for everyone affected by Hurricane Ian. The swift, organized response of our Sun
team members in the preparation and cleanup from the hurricane was remarkable and selfless.
We are pleased with our results this year-to-date, and our outperformance demonstrates both the resilience of our properties and our
strength as operators. Our portfolio of best-in-class assets in high-demand locations is strategically positioned to continue creating
value for stakeholders through varying economic cycles.
Our proven track record of execution, facilitated by an operational platform, which is second to none, allows Sun to provide continued
growth. Our third quarter was exceptionally strong, exceeding the high end of our guidance. As Fernando will detail, we are raising our
midpoint of full year FFO guidance.
Resilience of each business segment is evident in our results. Manufactured housing, Same Property NOI increased 4.9% for the quarter
compared to last year, supported by 4.3% gains in monthly base rent per site, increased occupancy and our ability to manage expenses.
Importantly, our U.K. operations, which are included in our manufactured housing segment, are performing in line with expectations,
demonstrating continued resilience amid economic uncertainty.
Park Holidays team has been operating the portfolio since 2005 and are cycle tested, having demonstrated consistent execution and
value creation through various economic conditions. Similar to how we see new residents trading into manufactured housing in the U.S.
during times of economic challenges, we are experiencing continued strong demand for domestic holiday homes in the U.K.
RV communities continue to experience high demand, and transient conversions to annual leases accelerated 30% as compared to the
third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date, we have converted approximately 2,000 transient sites to annual leases, which exceeds our full year
record set in 2021. Each conversion equates to a 40% to 60% revenue uplift the first year and creates a new stream of recurring revenue.
On a Same Property basis, annual RV revenues increased 13.4% and total NOI grew 8.4% compared to the third quarter last year.
Monthly base rent per RV site increased by 7% year-over-year. On a combined basis, blended total portfolio manufactured housing
annual RV occupancy was 97.1%, with over 2,300 revenue-producing sites gained year-to-date.
Looking ahead to 2023, we are positioned for continued organic growth in manufactured housing and RV as we expect to realize average
rental rate increases of 6.3% for manufactured housing and 7.8% for annual RV at the midpoint, both represent material increases on a
year-over-year basis.
Marinas continued to experience strong performance. Same marina real property NOI increased 9.6% in the third quarter compared to
last year, driven by increased annual boat slip revenue and storage revenue. Demand for slips and storage is persistent and over 85% of
the Safe Harbor Marinas have waitlist to join as a member.
In terms of external growth, we are and will remain very selective in approaching new opportunities. Since our second quarter earnings
call in July, we have closed on $24 million of new acquisitions. We also sold 1 RV community in California for $15 million.
Our development platform continues to be a differentiating and exciting growth driver over the long term, and we are pleased to have
John focused on the pipeline of manufactured housing development communities. During the quarter, we delivered over 170 expansion
and greenfield development sites. On the ESG side, we are proud to report that our (inaudible) score came back in the mid-60% range,
which represents a 42% improvement from last year's score. This was only our second year of participating in (inaudible) and we are
pleased to be scoring in line with our peers. Our team continues to work hard to build on this momentum as we enhance our ESG
protocols and reporting. Scale, the quality and locations of Sun's properties, along with our unrivaled team, gives Sun a clear competitive
advantage through all economic cycles. We are well positioned to continue delivering value to our stakeholders through our proven
resilient platform.
I would like to thank all of our team members for their ongoing contributions and efforts, which makes Sun what it is today. I also want to
congratulate Bruce Thelen, who will take over the Chief Operating Officer role in 2023. Since joining the company in 2018, Bruce has
been a vital member of Sun's leadership team. He has consistently grown his responsibilities related to manufactured housing and RV
property operations. Bruce and John have worked together overseeing the operations team, and I look forward to Bruce's continued
leadership.
I will now turn the call over to John and Fernando to speak to our third quarter results in detail. John?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Thank you, Gary. Third quarter results have demonstrated Sun's resilience. For the quarter, Same Property manufactured housing and
RV NOI increased 6.4%, driven by a 4.7% increase in monthly base rents per site and a 200 basis point increase in occupancy. Same
Property manufactured housing communities recorded a 4.6% increase in revenue and a 4.9% increase in NOI for the quarter compared
to the prior year period.
Annual RV revenue increased 13.4% in the quarter due to the record number of transient annual lease conversions continuing to build on
the success we have been delivering. The record transient to annual conversions, Gary mentioned, translated into having almost 7%
fewer sites to rent during the third quarter. Notwithstanding this fact, we increased transient RV revenue 60 basis points during the
quarter.
Marina's Same Property NOI increased by 9.6% for the third quarter, which was 60 basis points ahead of the high end of guidance. The
outperformance was largely driven by increased operating revenue from wet slips and dry storage space demand and expense savings
across the portfolio. Our U.K. portfolio performed well, and we are experiencing continued strong demand for holiday homes.
Additionally, Park Holidays has proactively locked in utility costs through 2024, which will benefit our residents. The integration of our
U.K. operations continues to advance smoothly, and we'll continue to realize synergies between our team's systems, technologies and
methodologies over time.
Development and expansion activity remains an important contributor to our long-term growth. We continue to entitle land and
locations with high-structural demand in order to maintain a robust pipeline of future embedded growth. Accordingly, in the quarter and
through the date of this call, we purchased 4 fully entitled manufactured housing land parcels for a total of $20 million that provide an
opportunity to develop approximately 800 additional sites.
During the quarter, Sun sold 724 new and pre-owned homes in our communities. New home sales prices averaged $183,000 for the
quarter, up $31,000 from the prior year. This 21% increase in the past year reflects the high quality and demand to live in a Sun
community. The demand to live in a Sun community is also evident as total portfolio manufactured housing and RV occupancy reached
97.1% as of September 30.
The average rental rate increases for 2023 are expected to be between 6.2% and 6.4% across our MH portfolio, excluding the U.K., where
we expect an average rent increase in the range of 7.2% to 7.4%. For annual RV, we expect rental rate increases of 7.7% to 7.9%, in a
range of 7.3% to 7.6% increases in marina rents.
As previously disclosed, Hurricane Ian caused significant flooding and wind damage at 3 RV properties and damage to the seawall and
docks at one marina, all located near Fort Myers, Florida. Prior to the hurricane making landfall, we acted our emergency plan. Our team
members, along with third-party contractors, began restoration work as soon as it was safe to return on site.
We organized convoys of supplies, food and travel trailers to our Florida properties. We could not be more proud of the entire team and
effectively managing through a challenging situation. We expect that our property, casualty, flood and business interrupted insurance
will fully cover us net of deductibles. We are grateful for and humbled by the dedication of our team members and pleased with the
company's performance to date.
I will now turn the call over to Fernando to discuss our financial results in more detail. Fernando?
 
Fernando Castro-Caratini
Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Thank you, John. For the third quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share on a constant currency basis of $2.71, a 28% increase
above prior year results and exceeding the high end of our quarterly guidance range. The outperformance was driven by total marina real
property, net operating income, interest income, U.K. corporate tax favorability and lower corporate costs.
As of September 30, Sun had $6.7 billion of debt outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and has a weighted
average maturity of 8.8 years. As of quarter end, our net debt to trailing 12-month recurring EBITDA ratio was 5.7x. Excluding our bank
revolving credit and term loan facilities, the remaining $4.9 billion of debt has a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and a weighted
average maturity of 9.9 years.
In terms of capital markets activity, during the quarter, we repaid $318 million of debt, secured by 35 properties, increasing our
unencumbered assets to total asset ratio to nearly 79%. We are also in the process of executing on approximately $310 million of
mortgage refinancings for a portfolio of properties, which is expected to reduce our variable rate debt exposure to approximately 16%.
As mentioned on our last call, in July, we swapped GBP 400 million of our GBP 875 million debt outstanding on our term loan from
variable rate to fixed rate through 2025. Lastly, since our second quarter call, we settled all remaining forward equity agreements on
approximately 540,000 shares for $95 million in net proceeds. In total for the quarter, we settled 1.5 million shares that netted
approximately $276 million of proceeds used to pay down borrowings on our credit facility.
Turning to guidance. As summarized in yesterday's press release, we are increasing the midpoint of full year guidance on constant
currency FFO per share by $0.08 to a revised range of $7.32 to $7.38. We are establishing fourth quarter 2022 constant currency core
FFO per share guidance in the range of $1.23 to $1.29.
At the Same Property level, we are moderating our full year manufactured housing and RV NOI expectations by 40 basis points, primarily
reflecting revised transient RV revenue expectations for the fourth quarter. The new range represents 6% growth at the midpoint for the
full year and implies a 6.6% growth at the midpoint in the fourth quarter.
For Marina Same Property, we are increasing the midpoint of full year guidance to 6.6%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior range.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Same Property Marina growth of 6.1% at the midpoint. As a reminder, our guidance includes
acquisitions, dispositions and capital markets activity through October 24, and the approximately $310 million of debt financing we are in
the process of closing, but it does not include the impact of prospective acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activities, which may
be included in research analyst estimates.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call up for questions. Operator?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Maybe starting on the home sales. If we look at the U.S., they obviously declined year-over-year. How are you thinking about that? And is
that a leading indicator of overall demand for the MH portfolio at all?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Nick, it's John. The answer to that is no. On the new home side, primarily what we saw was timing associated with the hurricane, which
actually happened on the 28th of September. So it's just as we were closing out the third quarter and it pushed out anticipated closings
that we had lined up in Florida for the -- into the fourth quarter. So we're seeing those close.
It also had an impact on the margin since some of those higher-margin sales are associated with those sales. So we expect to pick those
back up in the fourth quarter. On the preowned side, really, it has to do with -- fewer residents want to sell their homes, which gives us
less inventory to resell. That tracks the same with fewer broker transaction. I think it really speaks again to the best-in-class quality of our
communities, lifestyles that our residents have and they're holding on to their homes and staying longer even as home values continue to
increase. So no indicator whatsoever, just a little bit of timing.
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Nick, it's Gary. It's Gary. I would just add -- what's the average price $183...
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Yes. $183,000, which is industry-leading home prices.
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
So I think that's a good indicator. It's more of a timing issue.
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
That's helpful. And then just similar question on the U.K. side and the impact of higher mortgage rates and some resets there and how
you think that will impact home sales for Park Holidays?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I can tell you, Nick, that through the first 9 months of the year, Park Holidays' year-over-year growth in home sales is 13%. So very strong
demand continues.
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
And then just finally, for the $310 million of mortgage debt, what's the expected rate on that?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Nick, that's going to be between 4.5% and 4.6%.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
Can you walk us through the factors that are bringing down the MH and RV Same Property NOI guidance? I think you mentioned
transient revenue as a factor. And just while touching on transient revenue, it looks like Same Property transient revenue was up 60 basis
points, which is the same as last quarter. So after a strong year of transient revenue in 2021 and flat -- kind of flattish this year, have we
kind of hit the peak of where transient revenue can be?
 
Fernando Castro-Caratini
Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Michael, it's Fernando. So the main component to bringing the range downward for the full year -- for moderating that growth for the full
year in '22 is increased -- is our expectations for the transient revenue line item. That -- there are 2 effects to that. One, it's the record
number of conversions that we've had in the portfolio with almost 2,000 conversions year-to-date, which surpasses last year's record by
almost 20%, and we expect that to continue to climb into the fourth quarter.
And you stated it in your question, right? We had a record 2021 on the transient revenue side. So -- or expecting a moderation, right, of
growth moving forward. And that's settling into, say, pre-pandemic levels, where, on a same-property basis, that -- the transient revenue
line item was growing at about 3% per year. Our full year transient growth expectations, inclusive of the fourth quarter, would now be
around 3.5% for 2022.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
Got it. And sticking with Fernando, on the topic of expense growth, it was very well controlled in the quarter with 1% growth down from --
a deceleration from 7.3% last quarter. So what are the factors that kind of went into the expense control? Was it elevated growth last
year a factor? And I guess maybe more importantly, how sustainable are -- is growth at this kind of like low single-digit levels?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Sure. Thanks, Michael. So the primary driver for the lower operating expense growth would be on payroll, and that would be due to 2
factors. One is the roll-off of the increase that we put in place in July of 2021, which rolled off at the end of the second quarter. So a more
moderate growth from that perspective from that onetime increase.
And then in the third quarter, we did put in place some cost containment strategies on the payroll side and on the utility side across MH,
RV and marina. On a year-to-date basis, our expense growth for MH, RV is now at 6.3% and the same percentage for the marina side. So
certainly not expecting, say, 1% growth on a year-over-year basis moving forward, but did put in place some strategies to combat
inflationary, say, pressures that we were seeing at the portfolio.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
With the -- I guess, if you were to strip out the conversion, would you still be looking at a high single-digit revenue growth from that
segment? You've kind of referred to the 3.5% long-term average, but I'm trying to gauge if that's more of a high single-digit number on
an apples-to-apples basis. And then I guess maybe when you look at the utility expenses, what are you looking at next year when you
factor in some of these savings that you can implement?
 
Fernando Castro-Caratini
Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
On the, let's say, same-site basis for the third quarter in transient. So removing -- stripping the impact of the conversions for the quarter.
Growth would have been somewhere between 2% and 3%. So that answers the first question. From a utilities perspective, we have put in
place -- we put in place CapEx from a cost and payment standpoint that also helps on the environmental side, be that converting the
entire portfolio over to LED.
We've put in 13 to 15 arrays -- solar power arrays in California and are evaluating additional 13 to 15 in Arizona and Texas and a few other
states. So those are some of the investments that we're looking at to contain utility costs moving forward.
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
The other one I'd add, Fernando, while the remote WiFi static controls on all of our club houses or vacation rentals where we can actually
control the thermostat settings, the weekends and over the 9 new states has made a significant difference.
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
The only other thing I'd add, Wes, this is John. In most cases, our portfolio utility costs are passed on. Our residents, frankly, are in the
same boat as any one single family, but frankly, they have an advantage because our homes are typically smaller and cost less from a
utility perspective.
So I think that, that's an important point to bring up as well as on transient side of business, we capture those increases in the formal
rates that we charge for those sites.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. And then, I guess, where capital markets are today, would you consider stepping up the asset recycling to fund your acquisitions of
U.K. properties and I guess, more marinas at this point?
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Sorry, Wes, this is Gary. I missed the beginning of the question.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
I'm saying with capital markets, where they're at now, equity is obviously not an attractive price sale where the stock is today, but you are
still selling a few MH properties. What is the appetite to sell more MH to fund your growth in the new venture in the U.K. and more
marinas?
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Sure. I think that -- great question. Certainly, capital allocation and the cost of capital is front and center on this company as well as
many of the platforms that are out there today as rates. But I think what I would suggest is that our balance sheet has never been
stronger. We have strong annual cash flow.
I think, in general, we expect to see less cap rate expansion in our asset classes just due to the higher demand. We're interested in the
assets through the fact that they have historically demonstrated cash flow stability, resilience and strength through all economic cycles.
We have seen cap rate expansion in what I'd call a less than institutional quality properties that some would not be interested in, and we
look towards dispositions when we feel the properties cannot contribute the same amount of growth as the balance of the portfolio.
Oftentimes, those properties come to us as part of a larger transaction. So I think that we're always looking at asset managing our
properties, but there is no inclination at this time to sell properties and acquire properties in the U.K. In the U.K., we won't lose any
opportunities. We've actually been able to cherry-pick, if you will, 14 property acquisitions since we bought the Park Holidays platform. So
plenty of opportunity there with higher yields, higher opportunities.
So while we always take a look at dispositions and reallocation of our capital, there's nothing that I would point to right now, including,
fact of the matter is that the pound is down against the dollar, giving us theoretical greater buying power over there. But as we look at
things on a currency basis, that's not something that we are looking specifically to take advantage of. We're really very, very disciplined
watching cost of capital and matching it up and see opportunity to invest going forward. So that's our approach.
Last thing I'd add is the fact that if this had to come at a time when we were more pencils down on the sideline watching for
opportunities. We got an abundance of growth to extract the large amount of acquisitions we've executed on over the last 12, 18 months.
So a lot of internal opportunity as well as the opportunities related to expansion and development that John's working on.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street.
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
I just have a few follow-up questions on the U.K. business. John, you mentioned home sales were up 13% year-to-date. Could you give us
that same statistic for the third quarter?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Actually, John, I don't have that figure right in front of me. We can follow back up to you on that. I apologize. The same -- call it, the same
store figure for home sale revenue was up around 13% for the third quarter.
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
Okay, after the third quarter. All right. And then can you just give us a sense, Fernando or John, what drove the reduced guidance for the
U.K. NOI guidance that -- even on a constant currency basis?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
So John, I think that the primary driver there would be small adjustment to the seasonality of the Park Leisure transaction. As you'll
remember, that closed at the end of the second quarter, and that's about $1 million shifting from the second quarter to the third. But on a
constant currency basis, for the third quarter, we did perform in line with our expectations. So nothing more from that perspective.
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
Okay. Last one for me, just on 2 more volatile cash flow streams of the U.K. business, the holiday rentals and holiday home sales. And I'm
aware of the long-term track record of U.K., the Park Holidays team, they want to grow the home sales.
I'm just curious, every recession is different. So when you talk to the Park Holidays management team, will they say a reasonable bare
cases for home sales and holiday rentals, NOI streams, if we are on the precipice of a recession?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
John, I think the way I'd answer that is -- no, I know there's a lot of discussion about the macro headwinds that are out there. But I kind of
view it the best, it could be a tailwind, okay, for us and for of the thesis that we shared, when we announced the acquisition originally, as
an example, it is more difficult because of Brexit to travel to the continent. Now it's gotten more expensive because of the pound
devaluation.
Still fragmented. Still affordable vacation. And it's still easy for most people go in there because they're traveling within a 2-hour radius
to get to the properties, and it's a very established common form of vacation that takes place in the U.K. And so I think that we started
seeing higher inflation and things like that. But in the face of that, we're growing home sales in the U.K.
So I think that looking down the road, I mean, obviously, we'll have guidance when we come out with our fourth quarter results in
February. But I think the thesis holds for everything that we thought when we acquired the portfolio back in April.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
I just wanted to clarify, the 4 properties impacted by Ian are not operational and they're taken out of the same-store pool? Is that the
case?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
John, the 3 RV properties are currently not operational and would be taken out of the same-store pool from a performance standpoint.
We will -- consistent with prior practice, we will be putting in an adjustment for the expected business interruption proceeds that we
expect to receive for those 3 properties in the fourth quarter. So they would be out of Same Property, but the productivity or the expected
productivity net of any deductibles would be in our earnings. We would then, at some point in the future, actually collect on the proceeds
from business interruption.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
And any clarification you have on the payment of the business interruption insurance? I know you kind of netted it out on your charge for
the quarter. But I also wanted to ask, on a similar question, on the add-back that you had on the charge to core FFO. I realized it's kind of
deemed as a onetime item, but hurricanes seem like it's occurring more than once in a while in Florida. So I'm just wondering if you had
considered this more of a cost of doing business rather than a onetime item?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
John, this is John. I view it as a onetime item. We don't deal with events of this magnitude very often. The last time we dealt with the
storm of this magnitude was 5 years ago.
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Before that...
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Before that...
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
A decade or more.
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I mean I don't know what's the first one, [I dealt with it].
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
And then how confident are you on the $17.7 million of insurance proceeds?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
That is, at this time, that is our best estimate of what we will recover from an insurance perspective. We'll update the market if those
estimates were to change.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Gary or John, I guess on the MH front, given where CPI is running sort of over 8% and then you have the adjustment to sort security, was
there the ability to maybe even push rates higher on the MH side? Maybe walk us through kind of your process of getting that 6.5%
pushed for the residents at this time?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Samir, it's John. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. Here's how we think about it. We view rent increases like a marathon versus a
sprint. I think that I probably shared this with Gary a lot of times. But the most expensive site we have in our portfolio is a vacant one. And
I think that our strategy has stood the test of time.
For over 25 years, we've delivered positive revenue and NOI growth each and every year, while others have seen the ups and downs. We
continue to deliver long-term cash flow stability. We maintain a solid relationship with our resident base, which is also our sales force
that brings us the industry-leading occupancy growth that we've had.
And I'll add that at $183,000 a home, we command average home sale price to far exceed virtually all competitors in our asset class. I
think that illustrates the unmatched quality and value of our communities represent. So I think we view our strategy as well balanced
across all of our stakeholders, including our residents who live in a well-maintained community and see value creation in their homes.
And the bottom line is we have the ability to match our expected expense increases at over 90% of our MH sites, but the reasons I just
shared is why we're comfortable with the range where we're at for 2023.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal

Got it. And then I guess, Fernando, just on the balance sheet, just looking at the supplement, you get about $120 million in maturities in
'23. Kind of what's the plan to address that? Is it through primarily refinancing or paying down the debt? Maybe you can address that.
 
Fernando Castro-Caratini
Sun Communities, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Samir, the question, yes, we have, as we look out at our maturities over the course of the last couple of years, we have the next couple of
years -- we have no looming, no large maturity towers that would, let's say, re-rate our debt stack.
As Gary mentioned previously on the call, we have very strong free cash flow growth that, in the short term, can be used to pay down
anything from a revolving credit facility or these maturities coming due. We also, from time to time, have looked to lock in the treasury
rate over -- for future issuances. At this time, we have about $200 million locked in below 3% on the 10-year treasury. So we'll be looking
at pricing that's more advantageous than what you would get in the market today. But it's all part of our capital strategy. So we do
believe that great flexibility with regard to our maturities or any investments that we would make over the course of the next year.

Your next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
So on the U.K., the rate growth outlook was stronger than, at least, we had anticipated. I guess, how does the 7.2% to 7.4% guidance
compare with overall rate growth? And how do you think about balancing higher rates with demand just given the weaker economic
backdrop in the U.K.?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I think what we're seeing with a midpoint of 7.3% is higher. I mean they typically have been in the 5s. So it's markedly higher than it was
last year historically. The second part of the question, Brad?
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Just how do you think about balancing higher rates with demand given there's obviously a lot of recessionary pressures in the U.K?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I think, once again, I'd say what I shared a little bit earlier that I think that with what's going on in the U.K. and the difficulty to go other
places and the devaluation of the pound, I think that, frankly, that drives more domestic vacationing.
And it drives, as we're seeing with the home sales growth that they've produced over the course of 2022, considerable demand even over
last year, which was a pretty record year for them as well as in terms of home sales.
 
Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then is there anything that you can share on forward booking trends in the RV business?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I think bookings for Q4 or maybe pacing, and Fernando shared this in guidance, facing slightly below the range last year, but pretty close
to tracking the same. We'll provide guidance in terms of what our forward bookings look like into first quarter and second quarter when
we release earnings next time around.

Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
A quick question. What drove that incremental $0.11 of business combination expense and other acquisition-related costs and the revised
guidance?
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Josh, that would be a combination of expenses related to the U.K. transaction that came in through business combination as well as in
the quarter, we did walk away from a number of transactions that would include the deal costs.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Okay. Walking away from those deals, was it just related to the cost of capital or just -- or something else driving that?
 
Gary A. Shiffman
Sun Communities, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
The deal costs are directly related to the fact that cost of capital changed. We negotiated many of these transactions over a period of
months getting through due diligence and other forms of getting to closing and as the cost of capital to debt, et cetera, increased, we're
very disciplined with our expectations with the sellers.
As I shared earlier, the sellers' expectations are based on world as it existed 6 months, 12 months ago. And we believe a lot of those
opportunities will come back to us in the future, but matching up the cost of capital with the returns caused us to walk away from
numerous deals. And we are still in negotiations at this time on transactions.
In some cases, we do get adjustments satisfactory on the price side of things. But when we don't and we can't justify the yield and the
returns, based on the cost of capital, we will walk away from the transactions in a disciplined manner.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Appreciate that. And then one other for me. It looks like G&A increased $7 million quarter-over-quarter. What was kind of driving that
uptick?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Uptick, Josh, would be that deal costs are recognized in G&A. So that would be the primary driver in the sequential quarter-over-quarter
increase.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Okay. So I guess thinking about for 4Q and beyond, that $7 million kind of reverses. Is that the way to think about it?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
That's correct.

Your next question comes from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities.
 
Anthony Hau
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Associate
Can you guys remind me of the underwriting assumptions for Holiday Park expansions in terms of return, cost per site and lease-up time
line? And how many sites do you expect to develop annually over the next couple of years in the U.K. portfolio?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I think -- so for this year, Anthony, it's John. Thanks for the question. This year, we've already completed roughly 700 sites of expansion
development in the U.K. And I think previously we stated that we expect to stay in that range. Obviously, we'll match that up with
demand as we go.
I think I have to circle back with you in terms of the economics associated with the -- returns associated with those sites, which we would
be happy to do. Anthony, they would -- the returns would mirror our expected returns for expansions here in the U.S., so call it in the low
teens from an IRR perspective.
 
Anthony Hau
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Associate
Okay. And how long does it usually take to like lease those sites up? Is it similar to the MH portfolio to you in the U.S.?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
I think we'd see that those sites to get leased up, along with other vacant sites, they have in the portfolio over the course of a given year
that they've developed over the year.
 
Anthony Hau
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Associate
Okay. And my last question is like for G&A. So when the initial guidance came out last year, I think G&A was expected to be $235 million,
but it excludes the Park Holidays. I think G&A from Park Holidays is around $25 million to $27 million. So in total, that will be like $260
million.
At this current pace, it seems like G&A will be mid $240 million in 2022. So what is the difference between the initial guidance and now?
 
John Bandini McLaren
Sun Communities, Inc. - President & COO
Anthony, on an annualized basis, if you analyze our year-to-date figure, we would be at around 200 and the low 250s. The low end of our
range, inclusive of Park Holidays when we gave guidance, was at about $260 million. There is some translation from a currency
perspective with G&A from the U.K., to the tune of about $3 million to $4 million in translation.
And the rest, we have -- we are -- we did save over the course of the third quarter on payroll at the corporate level. So we are taking some
measures from that perspective with some delayed hiring and things of that nature.
