Steven B. Tanger
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - Executive Chair of the Board
Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. The hard work of the entire Tanger team is evident in
our results as we continue to provide a compelling value proposition to both consumers and retailers. Thank you to all of our
stakeholders for your ongoing support.
I will now turn the call over to Stephen Yalof.
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Steven, good morning. I'm pleased to announce another quarter of strong results. During the third quarter, we delivered solid
cash flows, occupancy growth, and a sixth straight quarter of rent spread improvement.
We executed our strategy of diversifying our tenant mix, adding new-to-platform brands, digitally native retailers, and food and beverage
concepts that attract new shoppers, extend dwell times and drive frequency of visits.
We delivered new commercial activations that supported TangerClub growth, marketing partnership revenues, and performance
marketing initiatives. Based on our positive outlook, we are raising our full year guidance, and we recently increased our annual dividend
for the second time this year, bringing our year-to-date dividend growth to over 20%.
We ended the third quarter at 96.5% occupancy, a 160 basis point sequential increase and up 210 basis points year-over-year. We have
recovered almost 500 basis points of occupancy since the trough we experienced during the pandemic. We have done so by curating our
centers with popular brands, entertainment uses, and great local and national food and beverage outposts, all of which continue to
enhance the Tanger shopping experience.
With occupancy above 96%, we're optimizing the composition of our centers and re-pricing our space, driving growth in rent spreads and
lease duration. We're increasing the stability of our cash flows by converting variable rents to permanent fixed rent while maintaining or
driving higher than previous percentage rates, contributing to additional long-term upside.
For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, we achieved positive blended rent spreads of 5.7%, including an 18.6% spread on
re-tenanted space. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement with positive spreads for each quarter this year. We have also
extended lease terms with an average term of 8.5 years for new leases.
We continue to diversify and elevate our portfolio with new to platform brands and categories, including digitally native brands who
recognize the importance of the value channel in their retail ecosystems. Such brands that have opened or will be opening soon across
our platform include Serena & Lily, Summersalt, Regatta, Mack Weldon, Hey Dude, and Allbirds.
Additionally, this quarter we welcomed Ulta Beauty to our center in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. We have also converted a number of
high-quality national brands and popular local and regional tenants from temporary or pop-up stores to long-term leases after they've
enjoyed sales success and new customer acquisitions in our centers.
Traffic in the third quarter was in line with our expectations, relatively flat for the total portfolio compared to the prior year as we comped
a particularly strong quarter last year. Our performance marketing programs provide targeted interaction with new and existing
shoppers, and we've had great success converting these new shoppers to our paid TangerClub program, where enrollment was up 25%
this quarter and continues to build.
Average tenant sales productivity was also relatively flat for the quarter at $446 per square foot for the 12 months ended September 30,
2022, compared to $448 per square foot in the prior year period.
We attribute flat sales to a higher level of promotional activity in the stores compared to a year ago, particularly in our moderate
categories as retailers leverage the outlet channel to clear excess inventory.
Additionally, the more aspirational brands in our portfolio continue to see strong sales performance with less promotion. Retailers on
center promotional activity facilitated by our marketing partnerships team, enable participating brands to further drive in-store traffic
through paid media, activations, and Tanger digital promotions. We have had immediate impact at our partnership property in Palm
Beach.
Over the past 90 days, we've rebranded the asset Tanger Outlets Palm Beach, completed transactions with new national brands and
stood up our marketing partnership, customer service, and Tanger Club programs, which all contribute to elevating the shopping
experience for the existing customer base, driving new shoppers to the center, and generating additional revenue.
With less than a year until grand opening, construction at Tanger Outlets Nashville is underway. Leasing activity has been brisk as we're
over 75% committed with top brands in retail, new to platform retailers, and the best national and local food and beverage offerings.
Our projected opening in fall 2023 with a stabilized yield of 7% to 7.5% remains unchanged. Even as we are encouraged by our strong
performance, we are cognizant of the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We remain prudent with near-term capital allocation and
may delay certain nonessential projects as the economic environment shifts.
We are optimistic going into holiday shopping season, and I'm encouraged by our momentum and look forward to reporting on our
continued success.
As a values-led organization, we are proud of our commitment to our people, our planet, and our communities. In September, we
awarded $160,000 through more than 140 TangerKids Grants with a key focus on supporting more inclusive classroom environments for
underserved schools and student population.
Last month we raised over $450,000 through Tanger Pink in support of funding breast cancer research, support, and care services, and
nationwide awareness campaigns. With the support of our customers, we've raised over $22 million to support these initiatives over the
past 25 years.
We continue to execute to our sustainability initiatives. Virtually all centers in our managed portfolio now have free EV charging available
to our shoppers, and we are investing to grow these capabilities. Further, we are on track to meet our 2022 goals to double both the
number of EV charging stations at our centers as well as our solar footprint by the end of the year.
I want to welcome Michael Bilerman to the Tanger leadership team. Michael will join as Chief Financial Officer & Chief Investment Officer
at the end of this month, and you will hear from him on our year-end earnings call. Michael is a proven leader who brings a breadth of
relevant experience to this critical role for our company.
I want to thank our entire team, our customers, and all of our stakeholders for their continued support.
I would now like to turn the call over to Doug McDonald to take you through our financial results, balance sheet, and increased guidance
for 2022.
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Thank you, Steve. We delivered solid results for the third quarter with core FFO per share of $0.47, which was consistent with the same
period last year, although the prior year benefited from higher lease termination fees. Same Center NOI for the total portfolio increased
2.4% to $82.2 million.
We have further enhanced our well-positioned balance sheet. In September, we refinanced the loan on our joint venture property in
Columbus, Ohio, extending the term until October of 2032 at a fixed rate of 6.25%.
Our share of outstanding debt remains at $35.5 million. As of September 30, our net debt to adjusted EBITDAre was 5.3x for the trailing
12 months. Our weighted average interest rate was 3.3% with 95% of our outstanding debt fixed and a weighted average term to
maturity of 5 years.
Subsequent to quarter end, we amended our $300 million term loan and increased the outstanding balance by $25 million to $325
million. We extended the maturity to January 2027 plus a 1-year extension option, reduced the pricing margin by 5 basis points, and
incorporated a sustainability metric. We also amended our LIBOR swaps to adjusted SOFR and realized additional interest savings of
nearly 7 basis points.
In October, we refinanced the mortgage on our Southaven, Mississippi Center near Memphis, extending the maturity to October of 2026
plus a 1-year extension option. The new loan carries an interest rate of adjusted SOFR plus 200 basis points, and we increased the
proceeds from $40.1 million to $51.7 million.
With these financing activities, our weighted average term to maturity is now 5.9 years, and we have no significant debt maturities until
September 2026.
We have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position by utilizing a disciplined and prudent approach to capital allocation.
We currently have over $200 million of cash in short-term deposits and full availability on our $520 million credit facilities.
As of September 30, we have deployed nearly $22 million of the approximately $135 million to $145 million of total anticipated cost of
our Nashville development. Our dividend was well covered with a FAD payout ratio of 43% for the third quarter, and our Board of
Directors approved a 10% increase in the annual dividend to $0.88 per share last month.
Based on our strong performance to date and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing the midpoint of our
guidance for 2022. We now expect core FFO per share to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.83, a 4 and half cent increase at the midpoint. In
addition, we expect same center NOI growth at a range of 3.5% to 5% compared to our prior expectation of 3% to 4.5%.
As Steve discussed, while we remain optimistic going into the holiday season, our guidance incorporates macroeconomic uncertainty
that could impact fourth quarter percentage rents.
We have reduced our G&A guidance to between $68 million and $70 million from $69 million to $72 million previously. This is due to a
combination of expense management initiatives and a slower pace of new hires than budgeted.
We have also reduced our anticipated recurring CapEx and second-generation tenant allowance due to continued high retention along
with certain timing and scope changes on nonessential capital projects. For additional details on our key assumptions, please see our
release issued last night.
I'd now like to open it up for questions. Operator, may we please take our first question?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Our first question today is coming from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
I'm just hoping you could help us understand the elevated level of remaining lease expirations in 2022? Is that just kind of more
month-to-month leasing? And then if you could also touch on expectations for more leasing to deal with in 2023 or more lease
expirations to deal with in 2023 as well? And how much of an opportunity do you see there?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Good morning, Greg. So first of all, as far as the expiration activity that we saw this year, yes, it was probably higher than most years
because a lot of that COVID negotiation was burning off this year. You know we said in previous quarters, where we put in a position to
favor occupancy over rent, and we did shorter-term leases, thinking that we would re-price our real estate -- we'll have the opportunity to
re-price our real estate. Fortunately for us, we feel that we've got pricing power with our real estate, evidenced by the spread growth that
we showed this quarter. So we see that the population of expiring lease is an opportunity for us to continue to push our rents.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
And then just -- and is that reflective of the elevated expirations for 2022? Or is that short-term like mark-to-market -- sorry, short-term
month-to-month leases? Or is it just -- I'm just trying to understand, you've got like the 76% of leasing completed versus for 2022 versus
last year, where it was lower, but the expirations are higher. And so I'm just trying to understand the kind of delta between those two.
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. Well, as rents continue to build, there's a lot of opportunity for us and our retailer partners to start making commitments for the '22
and the '23 leases right now. And obviously our retailer partners want to lock in rents as rents continue to build. We've also done a really
good job of sweeping a lot of that overage rent from a lot of the leases, the COVID leases into permanent fixed rent. So that's been a
strategy of ours as well.
So as we continue to have 6 straight quarters of spread growth, we're taking advantage with a relatively low OCR of about 8.5% versus
historical high OCRs pre-COVID, in the low double digits. We think we've got a lot of bandwidth to push our rents going forward.
And our leasing team is absolutely taking advantage of that opportunity. And our retailer partners have the tolerance to pay more rent,
particularly in our platform.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Just as financing market becomes more challenged generally, you guys have obviously done a good job with your balance sheet. But do
you expect that to create opportunities to utilize your balance sheet for external growth?
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Sure, Greg. This is Doug. I think you're right. We do believe that we'll create opportunities. We're fortunate to have a strong balance
sheet. We've got over $200 million of cash in short-term deposits. We've got the revolver capacity that we talked about, and we'll
continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy that capital and do expect the capital market dislocation to create some opportunities.
 
Operator
Your next question today is coming from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
I guess, first, I just wanted to follow up on that. Hopefully I'll still have a question, a follow-up after that. But just related to the spending
initiatives, I think, Steve, you mentioned that you might actually delay certain initiatives in your prepared remarks. Can you just elaborate
on that? And I wasn't sure if that's new developments that are in the pipeline or sort of shadow pipeline or certain redevelopment
initiatives or something else?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Good morning, Todd. So the answer is the -- what I was referencing in the prepared remarks was really some of the proactive work that
we do on our shopping centers to just make sure our centers are always looking, what we call Tanger appropriate, meaning we think
we've got some of the best looking shopping centers in the industry and we've done a lot of proactive work. We're constantly reinvesting
in the look-and-feel shopping centers.
That being said, as we're staring into this macroeconomic environment, that may change. We've said that we're going to be prudent with
our spent and we will give ourselves the opportunity to maybe delay some of that spent. But it really is the wants to have as opposed to
need to have. In the event that there's like safety or any maintenance, we're always going to spend capital to make sure that our centers
are in great condition to receive our shoppers and customers.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
So that comment, it generally, I mean, it reflects the reduction in the CapEx that was updated with the guidance. Is that part of what
you're referencing?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
And then just a question around the guidance. So the revised guidance implies $0.44 in the fourth quarter. Can you just walk us down
from $0.47 in the third quarter to that $0.44 midpoint just so we can get a sense of, I guess, the run rate heading into 2023, a little bit
better to the extent if there's anything that we should be thinking about?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure, Todd. The -- we continue -- we remain optimistic about the fourth quarter, the holiday sales period. But we do have more variable
rent exposure historically in the fourth quarter, just given the larger volume of sales production that these stores do. And we wanted the
guidance to incorporate the macroeconomic uncertainty and allow for some volatility in that number.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
So it's primarily around percentage rent that might come off a little bit, just given the softer sales environment?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, it's -- right, variable rent with sales. And just remember, softer sales, we're still -- we're an outlet channel. Outlet channel is a value
channel. And a lot of our retailer partners see that value channels opportunity to be very promotional, to clear excess inventory. So we're
not necessarily seeing softer sales compared to last year. What we're seeing is lower price points compared to last year.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
And then just the last question, Steve. I just wanted to ask about your thoughts more generally around the post-holiday season and
potential for some fallout or some vacates, which is typical after the holidays, right? So thoughts around that heading into '23, Obviously
we're coming off of a very muted year in terms of space recapturing. So just curious to get your take as we sort of turn the corner here into
'23. And then curious if you have any thoughts specifically that you might be able to share around rue21, they represent 1.4% of your base
rents, any expectations there?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, look, the leading indicators that we look at relative to retailers' performance and how we think they're going to perform for the
fourth quarter and what they are -- what our expectations are for their tendency to remain in our shopping centers has to do with the
renewal rates.
I mean if you take a look at -- I just mentioned in the last question that we probably had a disproportionate amount of renewals this year
versus other typical years just by virtue of the COVID adjusted leases burning off this year.
And what we've found in years past, about 80% of our leases will renew this year. We'll probably have over 90%. Very few retailers are
closing stores right now. Particularly in stores that are amortized because it's tough for them to replace and restore the cash flows, they'll
have to make sizable investments in order to do so. So because of that paradigm, we're finding retailers stepping up, paying more rent,
particularly on renewals in our platform.
With regard to the watch list, which is the second sort of leading indicator as to where we see the health of our retailers, our watch list
has never been smaller.
And then you mentioned specifically rue21, and your recent conversations with rue21, I think they believe their business is going to sustain
the holiday shopping season, and we're very optimistic about them staying within our portfolio and ultimately growing.
 
Operator
Your next question is coming from Craig Mailman from Citi.
 
Craig Mailman
Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst
Maybe Steve, I'm just kind of curious, you guys have had some good momentum this year on the occupancy side and rent side, you have
the new partnership on the kind of the management branding piece down in Florida. I'm just kind of curious, as we stand here today, how
much more runway do you think you have from the existing portfolio to drive AFFO growth here over the next few years from either
re-tenanting and kind of merchandising mix, some of these partnerships? Just trying to get a sense of your ability to sustain this
momentum.
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, first of all, there's a lot of new retailers that are starting to find the outlet channel and looking to us to grow their portfolio. I would
say probably in the past 4 or 5 years, there were fewer retailers. So therefore the supply and demand equation was a little bit tougher.
Right now we're seeing, with all this new interest and we've got a great population, our leasing activity has never been stronger. I rattled
off the name of a couple of brand, new brands to our platform, add brand new brands to outlet that have entered or will be opening
stores with us shortly.
So we think that there's a lot of opportunity for new brands to join. I think a lot of those new brands will help us absorb some of that
occupancy that we still have outstanding. And we're going to continue to push our rents. I said historically, we were in the low double
digits from an OCR point of view at 8.5. We're still relatively inexpensive at low double digits, we'll still be inexpensive, but we think
there's great runway for us to push.
We can only push based on the churn in our portfolio, our ability to lease some of that available space so that we can churn the entire
portfolio over at one particular point in time, but we've had some real consistency. I keep on going back to 6 successive quarters of
spread growth. We're focused on pushing rents. And in the past where occupancy was our strategy, now we're going to favor rent over
occupancy on a going-forward basis.
 
Craig Mailman
Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst
And you guys -- you made the point CapEx is down because retention is up, and you may have delayed some nonessential projects here.
But from a kind of net effective basis or NPV basis, I mean, how much better is the leasing coming in from a contribution to cash flow
than maybe what you guys originally thought at the beginning of the year?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
On some of the new deals, you can look at our supplement. We've raised rents on permanent deals by $10 and TAs have gone up by the
same $10. But what the important metric there is, we're also growing the term of those leases. So that's a good trade for us.
 
Craig Mailman
Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst
And then just last one. As you guys think about the future here, your cost of equity capital is still kind of high single digits. Cost of debt is
moving higher. Again, you're having some success here on the operating portfolio, which will hopefully improve that cost of capital.
But as you guys think about maybe the opportunity set coming out of some dislocation here, how are you guys positioning yourself from
either sourcing capital partners or trying to figure out how to best kind of stretch that capital to be as accretive or less dilutive as possible
to potentially grow the portfolio here?
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Sure, Craig. I think Palm Beach is a good example of that, where very little capital investment, and we're going to partner with them,
grow value at the asset, and we'll continue to look for opportunities where we can partner with other capital providers that may have a
lower cost of capital and look for acquisition opportunities, development opportunities, opportunities to deploy capital.
We're also focused on reinvesting in our own portfolio and enhancing the assets, investing in sustainability initiatives, investing in the
outparcel strategies that we've talked about. Obviously Nashville is a piece of our growth, and we locked in a lot of our capital for that
last year through the equity offerings and our bond transaction that was able to lock in the cost of capital against the yield that we've
stated in our expectation.
So we're continuing to evaluate a lot of opportunities than obviously keeping a close eye on the debt capital markets and equity markets.
And we'll -- we do have the ATM capacity still available to the extent that our stock price is at a level where the issuance makes sense
relative to the proceeds and the investment opportunity. The use of proceeds is what I meant to say.
 
Operator
Your next question is coming from Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I noticed there's a lot of skepticism still in a lot of these questions and a lot of the investors still out there despite the fact that you guys
have performed pretty well year-to-date relative to the REIT index or, frankly, to your mall peers as well.
Just I was curious -- and maybe we're asking the question the wrong way, but outlets should have a cruising speed of around 3% based
on fixed rent bumps and based on your CAM. Obviously your cruising speed near term is going to be higher or your growth in underlying
NOI should be higher because of your SNO, your further occupancy gains, the ancillary revenues, the higher OCR, the variable to fixed, all
of those initiatives.
Maybe if you can touch on the SNO pipeline, touch on the -- how we measure going forward to your ancillary revenues? And also when
can you get back to '19 levels of NOI? I think you've reported $304 million of NOI in '19. Obviously you're going to be short of that this
year. Can you achieve that next year? Maybe if you can give us some more color on that; that will be very helpful.
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Sure. We don't want to provide guidance for next year's NOI or the growth rates, but you raised some good points. We do have
contractual escalators in a lot of these leases. There's built-in annual rent bumps often around 3%. We do have opportunities to continue
to grow our occupancy or replace lower productivity occupancy, the short-term type tenants with more permanent higher rent payers.
We also have the 8.5% occupancy cost ratio that Steve referenced. We believe that that average, there's a tolerance from a lot of these
retailers that want to stay in Tanger Centers and our valued partners, and they're willing to step up to market rents to retain their space.
So we think there's an opportunity to grow the occupancy, grow the rents, and continue driving same center NOI growth.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
What is your SNO pipeline today, your signed, not open pipeline?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
It's about 0.5 percentage point.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So 50 basis points still?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
That's right.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
And that's consistent with, I guess, last quarter as well. But in terms of -- while I'm not asking you to provide guidance for next year,
obviously, but are you guys internally focused on trying to get back to that? And do you have a goal to get back to the '19 levels of NOI
over the medium term?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
That's the North Star. We want to beat that number, Floris. I mean, we're doing -- look, our results are proving out our strategy. We've
been talking about our strategy fairly consistently. And we shape our operations. We're going after new brands, new uses to fill our
space.
What we're finding is we're absorbing a lot of space. We're monetizing our peripheral land where we think there's a whole new revenue
stream for us that will first start cash flowing in '23 and well on into '24 and beyond. So we're going after organic growth in the existing
portfolio, then adding Nashville, which will come online at the end of next year, and we're seeing great results in our Palm Beach
partnership as well.
And we think that there's many other opportunities for us ahead. But once again, we're very focused on our core business and our core
strategy. And I think that that's where most of these results are coming from today. We're going to continue pushing hard on that.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
And if I can have one follow-up. You talked a little bit about new to market tenants and some digitally native brands, in particular, you
mentioned that are coming to your -- presumably, you're competing with Simon for some of these, and they're also opening Simon
outlets, I would imagine as well.
Maybe if you could touch on, one of the strengths in retail has been the luxury element. Obviously outlets are not necessarily perceived as
luxury, but you do have some luxury tenants, particularly Tapestry brands that are in your outlets. Do you see the potential for you to
bring other luxury tenants to the outlets? And particularly now that with the ESG, they can't burn their excess inventory anymore, not
that they have a whole lot of excess inventory, typically, but as they want to dispose of things that aren't selling that season, potentially
increasing or getting the revenues from that by selling through in outlets. Do you see an opportunity there for you going forward?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Definitely.
 
Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Presumably that could show up in additional leasing going forward?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I think we've got some elevated setters between Palm Beach, Nashville, and a number of our other centers across the portfolio.
We've got a great opportunity to push into new categories. We've proven that we can do that. We continue to do it. We have a whole
team that's focused on going after brand, new brands, new brands to outlet, and we keep on proving success and very willing to share
the names of those brands as we ultimately open those stores.

Your next question is coming from Samir Khanal from Evercore.
 
Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Steve, can you provide some more details on the occupancy pickup in the quarter? I mean just curious that -- saw that there are a few
properties in kind of your listing to Atlantic City Riverhead that saw a big jump. Maybe provide further details on kind of what you're
doing in those assets, what was driving that occupancy and now that you're sort of at that 96.5% range, which was much higher than I
thought sequentially, kind of what the upside is here?

Thanks, Samir. And I think a lot of that increase has to do with our pivoting into new uses. So as you take a look at Riverhead as an
example, we recently opened Michael -- Mitchell Gold and Crate & Barrel and our restoration hardware store. So essentially what we're
doing is we're building a destination for home in that particular location.
Same with our center in San Marcos, where we've been very successful doing a number of big home deals in that market as well. Atlantic
City is a location where we were able to do some entertainment uses. We signed a big lease with Dave & Buster's. So we're taking each of
these individual centers. We're mindful of who our customer is in those centers, what they're looking for when they come and they visit,
and what role our center plays in those communities.
And where those communities are underserved with particular uses, those are the uses that we're going after. We're still pure-play outlet,
but it's great to round out that merchandising with other uses that give other folks that come to visit our shopping centers things to do.
And, again, what it does, you get people to arrive more frequently, draws a new customer, get them to stay longer when they're there,
and ultimately build bigger baskets, which drive bigger sales.

And then remind me, but I think temporary tenants are going to be part of that number, right? And I guess if so, I mean, what percentage
make up sort of temporary tenants then?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We said in the past that temporary tenancy was over 10%. We don't break the numbers out. That number is actually going to start to
come down as we convert a lot of these temporary or pop-up tenants into long-term for new deals, and we start to absorb a lot of that
space with retailers, successful retailers that are expanding.
We've seen a lot of that through the portfolio, particularly this year. And, again, these new brands that are finding outlet, we're doing
long-term permanent deals with a lot of these brands. And they're going to make exciting new additions to our shopping center.
So we feel pretty optimistic about our occupancy growth. But more importantly, we're really optimistic about our rent growth. And I think
those two things together are the key fundamentals to us growing our business on an organic basis.

And just one last for me -- one last question for me on pricing power into next year. Certainly when you think about leasing spreads, I
mean, it sounds like you'll see continued improvement in that number. I mean, is that correct? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, I
know occupancy costs are low. But when you look at sales, sales are relatively flat year-over-year. So I guess how much -- I mean, how
much more upside or improvement do you think you can see on pricing power into next year?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, first of all, we're cheap, right. Our space is cheap. We definitely have pricing power. We have opportunity to push rents. You can see
it in the numbers. But again, if you look at the flat sales, and I just want to make sure that we understand we're an outlet center.
So when you have one of the largest national retailers announce that in order to keep their full-priced channels clean with brand-new
inventory and that they're going to close out all of this excess inventory through the outlet channel. Essentially what's happening is
they're being more promotional in our channel so that they can be more clean and push prices in the full-price retail channel.
In those instances, our channel is doing exactly what these retailers are paying for. They're looking for customer traffic to have
promotional selling in a value-oriented environment where we're joining customers to the shopping center, and they have the ability to
clear that excess inventory.
So not every retailer is looking at outlet the same way. It's not all about the high watermark of sales. It's being promotional, clearing
excess inventory, and making sure that it's serving a purpose to the entire omnichannel retail ecosystem for each of those individual
retailers.
We have a number of retailers that only sell excess in our channel. And they're promotional, and it serves a great purpose and keeps their
margins high in their full price business. And that's why there's -- many of our retailer partners have served in multiple channels.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question today is coming from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Steve, I was wondering if you could tell us the national tenants that Tanger brought to Tanger Outlets Palm Beach? And are there any
operational changes that you might bring to the asset?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, the reason why we made the partnership was because of our operational excellence and what we bring to the table. I mean, first of
all, branding the shopping center, Tanger has national reach. We've got a sizable TangerClub where our Tanger members pay into that
club, but get returned additional discounts, shopping days, and through our digital marketing strategies, we communicate with these
customers in a very personal way and drive them not only to the shopping center in their particular geography, but make sure that when
they're traveling, that they know that there's a Tanger shopping center close by. So that's number one.
Number two, from an operational efficiency point of view with 36, now with Palm Beach 37th and Nashville will be 38th shopping
centers, we've got great buying power and pricing power as it relates to national contracts. And those have served us extremely well,
whether its repairs and maintenance, janitorial, national landscaping or national security contracts, our partners definitely benefit from
that buying power.
We also have a leasing team that is a national leasing team that we can leverage when we add additional centers to our portfolio, we --
without growing the size of that leasing team, we can expand our reach, particularly with that national tenant population that's starting
to join us.
With regard to Palm Beach in particular, we have over 25,000 square feet of new tenants to that center that are in various stages of LOI
to execute it. And we have -- our partner and we will release those names in a shared press release as those stores open.
So we're not announcing stores. We're in a very competitive environment. We choose not to announce the stores until those stores are
open or their signs go up.

And then just, are there any rue21 stores that leases expire in 2023?
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Justin Stein, who's our EVP of Leasing, is sitting in the room. I'm going to ask him to answer that question.
 
Justin Stein
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - Executive Vice President of Leasing
Hello, Craig, how are you doing? We're in communication with all of our retailers on a monthly basis. In fact, I personally speak with the
CEO of rue21 every 3 to 4 weeks. And our portfolio was very clean with rue21 through '23, and we look forward, as Steve mentioned
earlier, to continuing to watch them turn their business around and grow.

Your next question today is coming from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
So 2 quick ones here. I guess first, for the 160 basis points in sequential lease rate pickup, can you give us a sense as to how much of that
was permanent occupancy versus temp?
And then for the second question, when Nashville opens next fall, what sort of occupancy do you expect it to open at and about how long
to stabilize?
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Sure, Mike. I'll take the first one. I'll let Steve answer the Nashville one. But while we don't break out the temp versus permanent to that
level, we do acknowledge that the second to third quarter is often when we see some of the seasonal, the holiday tenants that are
coming in. So that is a component of the 160 basis points of sequential gain, but we have strong momentum on the permanent side and
have continued to lock in long-term leases. That's a meaningful part of that number.
 
Stephen J. Yalof
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Look, we're not going to stop using temp leasing as a strategy. We've talked about the fact that we've decentralized our operations team.
Therefore with 37 open centers, we've got 37 general managers and operations team on the ground. And if there is a square foot of
unoccupied space, it's incumbent on them to find a retailer, a suitable retailer to take that space to keep the lights on.
And for us, I call it a strategy because with a great retailer in one of those spaces comes a potential for a long-term tenant, maybe a new
food and beverage use or some local retailer that does a great job of drawing a new customer in the shopping center that hadn't visited
before.
And that's important to us, it's important to our strategy, and it's important to the communities that we serve. So as we talk about
Nashville, we're 75% committed with a year to go in Nashville. We've been extremely selective with regard to the brands that are going
into that center. We've made a very real effort to make sure that we get some new brands so that it isn't just the same lineup that you'll
see in every outlet across the country.
We're inviting brand-new retailers into the portfolio and some of their new debuts will happen in that shopping center. There's a number
of brands, we're going to do a release shortly, but there's a number of very interesting brands that will be joining us there, and we're
really excited to welcome them to the Tanger family of brands.

And do you have a sense as to when the project opens, about roughly what the initial occupancy would be, just a rough range?
 
Stephen J. Yalof

I don't want to sort of get out over my skis here, but I know it will be in the 90s.

Your next question is a follow-up from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
I just want to quickly touch on base in percent rent in the context of the guidance raise, but also performance in Q3. So base rent was flat
to Q2 despite the increase in occupancy, so is kind of percent rent, the piece leading into Q4, we expect to see kind of the upside driving
the beat? Are you ahead on your break points there in the leases? And if you could also just kind of touch on again the base rent kind of
being flat to Q2; that would be appreciated?
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Sure. You're saying base rent.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
So base rent was $71.7 million in Q2 and Q3. So it was kind of unexpected given the occupancy increase. And then is that -- is the
expectation then just that percent rent is going to be kind of the driver of the performance in Q4 in regards to the beating raise?
 
Doug M. McDonald
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. - SVP of Finance and Capital Markets
Well, Q2 base rent included some of the reserve reversals that we talked about last quarter. So there were some nonrecurring items that
overstated the Q2 run rate, if you will. There was growth in the base rent from Q2 to Q3. And then on the variable side, that is something
where we continue to convert variable into fix that contributes to the base rent growth. But that also de-risks the stability of these cash
flows going into potential periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. So that's the strategy we'll continue employing. But we continue to see
growth in the base rent, the fixed rent category and also the recoveries category as we convert some of these leases into more of the full
break style.
