GAAP net income allocable to common shares in the third quarter was approximately $700,000 or $0.08 per share.
earnings available for distribution for the third quarter were $0.40 per share and included the net charge-off of the sale of a foreclosed office property of approximately $400,000 or $0.04 per share as our EAD policy is to charge off losses upon realized transactions as opposed to loss estimates required by GAAP.
Our projection remains subject to volatility from rate increases, loan payoff volume, CECL reserve adjustments and other nonrecurring or unexpected items that may arise in the remaining 3 months of the year.
Looking forward, we currently project that the company will produce GAAP income between $0.10 and $0.20 per share and EAD of $1.10 per share for calendar year 2022.
The increase to book value per share for the third quarter was primarily driven by $0.36 of per share accretion from common stock repurchases, $0.11 related to the noncash equity expense and net income of $0.08 per share.
GAAP book value per share increased to $25.08 on September 30 from $24.48 on June 30.
With the loan growth of $264.6 million in the first 9 months of 2022, we expect our net income and earnings available for distribution to remain positive and steadily grow for the balance of 2022 and into 2023.
Loan payoffs during the period were $83.5 million, and net unfunded commitments during the quarter were $27.9 million, producing a net increase of the portfolio of $69.9 million.
