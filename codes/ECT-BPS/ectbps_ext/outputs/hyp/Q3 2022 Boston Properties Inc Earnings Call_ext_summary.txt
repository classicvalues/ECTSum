We reported third quarter funds from operation of $1.91 per share that was $0.04 per share higher than the midpoint of our guidance.
For the rest of 2022, we have increased our guidance for full year funds from operations to $7.51 to $7.53 per share.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect growth from our acquisitions and development of $0.62 per share, offset by higher interest expense of $0.69, a reduction in NOI from asset sales of $0.16 and lower fee income of $0.03 and higher G&A expense of $0.04.
While not part of FFO, our net income included gains on asset sales of $262 million or $1.50 per share, primarily from the sale of 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, D.C.
We do not anticipate any further sales this year, and our total dispositions in 2022 is projected to be $864 million.
Higher revenues contributed $0.03 per share to our results from earlier than projected revenue commencement on space that we delivered to clients ahead of schedule.
We project our 2023 same-property NOI growth to be flat from 2022, and we expect that we will have positive same-property cash NOI growth our guidance assumes growth of 1% to 2.5%.
The increase is projected to come from higher revenue from the portfolio and our 125 Broadway acquisition, partially offset by the deferral of third quarter operating expenses into the fourth quarter and higher interest expense from both higher floating interest rates and incremental debt from funding our new investments.
The new [bid] midpoint of our 2022 guidance represents strong growth in FFO and of $0.96 per share or 15% over 2021.
The acquisition price for our interest implies a building valuation of $1.05 billion, which equates to just over $1,200 a square foot and a 5.3% initial cap rate.
The total cost to redevelop 300 Binney Street is $210 million, and the building will be delivered in the fourth quarter of '24.
In spite of the challenges with the new lease at 760 Boylston, we expect the overall contribution from retail to return to 2019 levels by the middle of '24 when the lease of 760 commences.
Lower operating expenses also contributed $0.03 per share, this was primarily from lower-than-projected repair and maintenance costs, most of which will be deferred into the fourth quarter.
That's an increase of $0.02 per share at the midpoint from our prior guidance.
Net absorption in the third quarter was negative 200,000 square feet for Premier workplaces and negative 1.7 million square feet for the rest of the market.
Given that 94% of BXP CBD space competes in the premier workplace market, we believe it's increasingly necessary to understand operating trends for the premier workplace segment of the market to assess and forecast our leasing performance.
