Our third quarter net income totaled $13.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share, and FFO totaled $61.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share, $0.02 above consensus estimates.
We did post FFO of $0.36 per share, which was 2% -- above $0.02 above consensus estimates.
So while exceeding consensus estimates for the quarter, we're keeping our FFO range unchanged at $1.36 to $1.40 per share, primarily due to the unstable interest rate environment and the impact of any potential sales.
We also terminated 2 potential acquisitions that we had underway since the quarter end.
We beat those estimates, primarily due to the combination of improved operating results, lower interest costs and a higher-than-anticipated gain on the 3151 Market Street formation.
We also further expect that sales of select properties out of our existing joint ventures will occur over the next 4 quarters.
Our spec revenue range remains in the $34 million to $36 million range, with $35 million or 100% at the midpoint achieved.
The stability of our operating portfolio, evidenced by low forward rollover, protection from operating expense increases on 81% of our leases well position us on the operating margin front, and we will certainly continue to focus on margin improvement as we enter the '23 budget cycle, and we are pleased that our '22 operating and development plans remain on target.
Our full year mark-to-market range remains 16% to 18% on a GAAP basis and 8% to 10% on a cash basis.
And based on our development activity, we are projecting to be at the upper end of our current range of 6.6 to 6.9 at the end of the year.
Tenant retention was 90%, and we ended the quarter slightly below 91% occupied and 91.8% leased.
We anticipate raising between $550 million to $650 million in proceeds within the next 90 days that will be used to pay off the February bonds and reduce our outstanding balance on our floating rate line of credit.
In addition, we are marketing an additional $200 million of properties for sale as part of our ongoing price discovery process.
From an operating standpoint, we continue to experience higher physical occupancy, now 60% overall with a high of 70% to 75% in the Pennsylvania suburbs.
We also posted rental rate mark-to-market of 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 6.9% on a cash basis.
Our CAD payout ratio remains at 84% to 95%, and that will likely be at the higher end of our range.
