I would like to quickly bridge the third quarter adjustable distributable earnings of $0.25 versus $0.24 recorded in the second quarter.
As for the remainder of the year, due to the rapid pace and level of deployment in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, combined with the recent slowdown in loan repayments, we are well positioned, all things being equal to maintain higher levels of cash while continuing to produce adjusted distributable earnings that support the $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.
Furthermore, as we have said consistently during the past 2 quarters, there has been a scarcity of lending opportunities as the demand for commercial real estate credit has significantly contracted.
During the third quarter, total company GAAP net book value decreased from $11.26 to $10.87 per share, while undepreciated book value decreased from $12.42 per share to $12.08.
Suffice it to say, we are experiencing interest rate increases and inflation levels not seen in 40 years.
We are coordinating closely with our borrower in an effort to resolve loan #41 in the coming months.
Currently, markets are pricing in a 75 basis point Fed interest rate increase later today, followed by a 50 basis point increase in December.
During the past 3 earnings calls, we sounded alarms due to the Fed's aggressive stance on inflation.
Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted distributable earnings quarterly run rate is closer to $0.24 per share.
Given our adjustable distributable earnings performance for the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.20 per share, unchanged from the prior quarter.
