NAREIT FFO was $0.49 per share in the third quarter, driven by same-property NOI growth of 3.6%.
As it relates to guidance, we have maintained our previous guidance range for same-property NOI growth at 5.5% to 6%, and we have revised our FFO guidance to a range of $1.94 to $1.97 per share.
As Jim highlighted, we are pleased to also announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend last night to $0.26 per share or $1.04 on an annualized basis.
And importantly, as Angela will discuss further, we have $1.3 billion of liquidity and no debt maturing until 2024, allowing us to be opportunistic from an external growth perspective.
As noted in last night's release, we have also renewed both our $400 million share repurchase program and our $400 million at-the-market equity offering program, which were set to expire in January, proactively extending our ability to capitalize on a wide range of capital markets condition.
Given our increased cash flow and confidence in continued growth, we are pleased to announce a dividend increase of 8.3%, which will keep us still at one of the lowest payout ratios in the sector as we utilize free cash flow to self-fund our value-add plan without reliance on the volatile capital markets.
Our execution delivered top line same-store growth of 4.8% and NOI growth of 3.6%, which is particularly impressive when you consider the drag of 250 basis points from revenues deemed uncollectible due primarily to declining prior period rent collections as we worked down our remaining receivables.
During the quarter, we signed 1.7 million feet of new and renewal leases at a record rent of $19.26 a foot and a blended cash spread of 14.2%, which included 660,000 square feet of new leases at a record rent of $21.20 and a comparable cash spread of 32%.
We stabilized $46 million in projects during the quarter at an incremental yield of 8%, bringing our year-to-date deliveries to $113 million at a 10% yield, creating significant value even in a higher cap rate environment.
And importantly, we have another $400 million leased and underway, providing a significant future value creation.
With that said, even in this more challenging capital markets environment, we've continued to find some liquidity to sell smaller and noncore assets at opportunistic values with over $110 million in sales transactions completed during and subsequent to the end of the quarter.
Our leasing activity drove overall leased occupancy to a company record of 93.3%, a year-over-year increase of 180 basis points.
Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $21 million or $0.07 per share of out-of-period collections related to prior years.
Base rent growth continues to accelerate, contributing 480 basis points to same-property NOI growth this quarter.
The revised dividend level represents a payout ratio of just over 50% of our third quarter FFO and a dividend yield of 4.8% on last night's closing stock price.
Year-to-date, as we've driven occupancy and improved recovery rates, we've grown bottom line FFO by 6.5% on a comparable basis.
