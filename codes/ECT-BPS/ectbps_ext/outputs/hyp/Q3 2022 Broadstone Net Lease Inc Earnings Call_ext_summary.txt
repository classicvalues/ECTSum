Proactive execution in the capital markets during the first 3 quarters of the year has positioned us to close out 2022 on a strong footing, delivering another year of consistent same-store portfolio performance and accretive external growth, both of which have translated into strong earnings growth.
We appreciate that net lease investing is not a 0 loss business and when occasionally taking calculated risks, situations can arise that require a carefully crafted solution.
