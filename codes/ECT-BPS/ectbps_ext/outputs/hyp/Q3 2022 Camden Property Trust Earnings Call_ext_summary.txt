My second question there with $0.07 contraction from the previous top end of guidance.
So I think, first of all, if you have a financial crisis, right, like we had in 2008 and '09 is sort of a different world...
Yes, there's a $0.07 decline in the top end, but there was a $0.07 rise in the bottom end and really just reflects the fact that we're a month into the last quarter of the year.
But as we've done in the past, when you can sell assets in the private market at 100 cents on the dollar and buy your stock at 75 cents on the dollar, that's a pretty good investment.
I think we have a projected supply from Ron Witten's number, about 180,000 new units coming into our markets.
And when you get down to it, we're not going to do a development that isn't a positive spread of at least 100 to 150 basis points wide of our weighted average cost of capital.
So it depends on who you talk to, you're down anywhere from 10% to 20%.
and it's likely to be less than the 180,000.
Well, as you saw in our release that we increased our buyback program authorized by the Board of $500 million.
It wouldn't surprise me to see some of that 180,000 shift into 2024.
And I'm wondering if this is Chapter 1 of a pretty meaningful deceleration beyond what would be called normal seasonal patterns.
So I would -- I think it would be more useful for most folks to look at it and say, give me 3 years' worth of numbers and over that period of time, I'll give you my employment forecast, and we'll see how that matches up versus trying to handicap any individual year.
Actually raised the guidance $0.01 for the full year.
I think the right way to look at the completions number is over maybe a 2- to 3-year period, just add them all up.
So real estate taxes, I'll address that 1 first.
And then let's reap the -- what we know, what I believe to be the underperformance and level setting that needs to happen in those 2 markets, and then we'll look at it at that point.
