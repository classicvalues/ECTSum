Last night, we reported core FFO for the quarter ending September 30, 2022, of $1.15 per diluted share, an increase of $0.17 or 17.5% from the same period last year.
In summation, the changes are discussed resulted in a reduction of $0.07 to the midpoint of our core FFO guidance to $4.46 per share.
Against that backdrop, Centerspace has performed well, and I'm delighted to report that core FFO per share is up 17% quarter-over-quarter and 11% year-to-date.
Revenues continue to drive growth with third quarter revenues increasing 11.1% over the same period in 2021.
I'm also happy to share that our guidance for the full year is for at least 10% core FFO growth, and the top line story remains encouraging.
During the third quarter, our same-store new lease rates increased 7.5% on average over the prior leases and same-store renewals achieved average increases of 8.7%.
As of October 31, we had repurchased a total of 427,000 shares or approximately 2.3% of our diluted shares at an average price of $67.25 per share for net consideration of approximately $29 million.
The growth in earnings was fueled by another strong quarter of same-store NOI growth, which increased by 11.4% versus the same period last year.
Despite increasing our same-store revenue growth guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint, our same-store NOI guidance is now lower by 75 basis points, driving a $0.03 reduction in the midpoint of our core FFO guidance.
Internally, salary and benefits costs have increased year-to-date 6.7% over the prior year, which is in line with CPI increases for wages and salaries through June.
Turning to guidance, which is presented on Page S 17 of the supplemental.
The acquisition of Lyra contributed another $0.02 worth of reduction to the midpoint of our core FFO guidance.
Our non-same-store portfolio achieved increases of 7.7% on average over prior leases with renewals up 9%, while retaining over 60% of our residents.
Year-to-date net operating income has increased 10.3% over 2021 as we manage to optimize revenue during the last 18 months of historic rent increases.
On a blended basis, this is third quarter rental rate growth of 8.2%.
And through the end of October, we've purchased around $29 million of our common stock.
