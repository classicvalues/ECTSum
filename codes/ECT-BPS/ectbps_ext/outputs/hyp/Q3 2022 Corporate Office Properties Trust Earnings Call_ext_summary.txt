FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 was at the midpoint of guidance and keeps us on track to achieve the midpoint of our expected annual results of $2.35 per share.
And this year, we expect to deliver 2.6% growth in FFO per share, absorbing the $0.04 of dilution from the sale of DC-6 in January.
We're on track to deliver 2.6% FFO per share growth in 2022, and we continue to expect compound annual FFO growth of 4% or greater from 2023 to 2026.
So in summary, we're well positioned to continue to deliver FFO growth this year and over the next 4 years.
We delivered 4.4% compound annual FFO growth from 2018 to 2021.
Our record leasing achievements this quarter provide clarity that we can drive our occupancy higher over the next 5 quarters.
We are narrowing our guidance for the change in same-property cash NOI from flat to down 2% to down between 1% and 2%, and the full year change in cash rents on renewals to a new range of down between 1% and 2%.
We expect the occupancy to increase 50 basis points in the pessimistic scenario with no further vacancy leasing and 200 basis points in the optimistic scenario.
Despite these rate increases and the pressures it places on our 2023 through 2026 forecast, we continue to expect to generate 4% or more compound annual growth in FFO per share between 2023 and 2026.
Given the success in the quarter and our knowledge of large tenant renewal intentions, we expect our portfolio occupancy to increase over the next 5 quarters irrespective of the volume of future vacancy leasing.
And given the substantial pre-leased development pipeline, we are positioned to deliver compound growth of 4% or better from 2023 to 2026 and to add valuable assets to our operating portfolio.
Our third quarter vacancy leasing was the highest quarterly volume in the last 12 years.
The base Defense budget for fiscal year 2022 was passed in March of this year with a 5.8% increase, and we expect the demand from that increase to continue to materialize through late 2023.
The $1.8 billion of bond refinancing completed provided the solid foundation for us to deliver future growth from our operating and development portfolios.
Our total portfolio is now 94.9% leased and 92.7% occupied.
Our retention rate was 92%, our highest in 21 years, and we fully leased 310 National Business Parkway to the U.S. government.
