We currently anticipate full year 2022 FFO between $2.69 a share and $2.73 a share with a midpoint of $2.71 per share.
On the earnings front, the team delivered $0.69 per share in FFO and same property net operating income increased 1.5% on a cash basis.
With the benefit of stable concessions, I'm pleased to note that net effective rents this quarter moved higher to $24.97 and a $1.47 increase relative to the first half of this year.
Leasing concessions, defined as the sum of free rent and tenant improvements came in at $7.66 per square foot compared to our previous 4 quarter average of $7.55.
This is up $0.01.
Our third quarter activity also produced a weighted average lease term of 8.3 years.
Cash net operating income during the third quarter increased 1.5% compared to last year.
We have only one customer greater than 100,000 square feet expiring during 2023, at 135,000 square feet and in the fourth quarter, and we are very encouraged about the status of that renewal.
Upon closing of the term with mortgage, we will have no significant loan maturities into 2024 and less than $100 million outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility.
Last, we currently have 890,000 square feet of new and expansion leases that are signed but not yet commenced.
Our transaction count was only 4 fewer than our record count last quarter, and our square footage volume was largely in line with our quarterly run rate in the first half of the year.
For the third quarter, our total office portfolio end of period lease percentage and weighted average occupancy were 90.1% and 87.3%, respectively.
Second generation net rents increased 4.8% on a cash basis in the third quarter, representing lower growth than in recent quarters.
For all of 2022, we anticipate parking revenues will be up a little under 9% compared to 2021.
This is an improvement from the first 2 quarters of the year, which were essentially flat with the increase largely driven by Amazon's lease commencement on July 1 for our entire Domain 2 property in Austin.
You will recall that the past 2 quarters, I mentioned we might see increased activity in Houston.
