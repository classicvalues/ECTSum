Turning to our outlook on Page 5.
To that point, we expect our discretionary CapEx to increase in 2023 to approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from approximately $1.2 billion this year.
And for 2023, we expect 4% site rental revenue growth, 3% adjusted EBITDA growth, and 4% AFFO growth.
Looking ahead to 2023, we expect overall leasing activity to remain healthy, resulting in growth in cash flows that supports the 6.5% dividend increase we announced yesterday.
Turning our focus to the fundamental trends we expect in 2023 on Page 6.
We expect revenue growth to return to approximately 3% by the end of the year.
As Jay mentioned, we continue to expect total churn from the T-Mobile Sprint network consolidation to be approximately $275 million, consisting of tower churn of approximately $200 million occurring in 2025 as well as approximately $45 million of small cell churn and $30 million in fiber solutions over the next 3 years.
However, with $225 million of remaining Sprint churn and $140 million of additional run rate interest expense, we expect dividend per share growth in 2024 and 2025 to be below our long-term target.
Core organic growth of more than 5% benefited from a robust tower growth of 7%, and included 4% small cell growth, and 1% growth in Fiber Solutions.
As I'll speak to in just a moment, I see tremendous opportunities ahead of us, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term target of growing dividends 7% to 8% per year.
Based on our customer agreements, T-Mobile is obligated to pay the remaining contracted revenue on those sites at the time of cancellation, resulting in expected cash payments of $165 million into 2023.
While also investing $7 billion of capital into attractive assets we believe will generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital and contribute to dividend growth in the future.
We anticipate another year of solid tower growth, complemented by a doubling of our small cell activity as we expect to install 10,000 nodes in 2023, up from 5,000 this year.
Turning to Page 4.
Since 2017, we have increased our consolidated return on invested capital by 160 basis points to 9.5% and returned over $10 billion to shareholders through our dividend that has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 9%.
With the increased mix in colocation, we expect our net CapEx to increase by only 10% over 2022 levels, reflecting attractive incremental lease-up returns.
