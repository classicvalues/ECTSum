FFO as adjusted for the quarter was $1.16 per share versus $0.86 in the prior year, and AFFO for the quarter was $1.22 per share compared to $0.92 in the prior year.
We are revising our guidance for 2022 FFO as adjusted per share to a range of $4.50 to $4.68 from a range of $4.50 to $4.60, reflecting an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint.
With that background, I thought it would be helpful to provide a reconciliation of the increase in the midpoint of our FFO as adjusted per share guidance of $0.04 to $4.59 from the prior midpoint of $4.55.

As Greg discussed, with approximately $250 million of future commitments, we are again demonstrating the depth of our investment pipeline yet we remain prudent in our capital deployment given the backdrop of challenging capital markets.
Cap rates are around 8% and should create compelling long-term value.
