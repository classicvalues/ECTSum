FFO per share for the third quarter was on the high end of our guidance range at $1.77 per share and compared to third quarter 2021 of $1.55 represented an increase of 14.2%.
I'm happy to finish the quarter at $1.77 per share in FFO and raise annual guidance to $6.93 per share, up 13.8% from the 2021 record.
Looking forward, FFO guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022 is estimated to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.77 per share and $6.91 to $6.95 for the year, a $0.03 per share increase over our prior guidance.
Some of the results produced include funds from operations coming in above guidance, up over 14% for the quarter, ahead of our initial forecast.
I'm grateful we ended the quarter 99% leased.
Based on our read through, we're adjusting forecast 2022 starts to $375 million.
To demonstrate the market strength, over the past 2 years have produced a number of quarterly records for the company.
Our quarterly occupancy averaged 98.3%, which was up 120 basis points from third quarter 2021.
Finally, cash same-store NOI reached 8.7% for the quarter and stands at 8.9% year-to-date.
And at quarter end, we're ahead of projections at 99% leased and 98.5% occupied matching our company record occupancy.
Similarly, quarterly re-leasing spreads were strong, both above 39% GAAP and 23% cash.
And as a result, we only issued $1 million of equity.
Year-to-date re-leasing spreads are similar at 36% and 22% GAAP and cash, respectively.
In addition to these, we have another 8 projects, which are 100% leased prior to construction completion.
This issuance included 2 tranches, 1 for $75 million with a 5-year term and another for $50 million with a 2-year term.
During the third quarter, we closed on $125 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.04%.
