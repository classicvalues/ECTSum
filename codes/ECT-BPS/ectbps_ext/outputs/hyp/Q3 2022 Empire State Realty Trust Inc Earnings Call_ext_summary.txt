For the third quarter of 2022, we reported core FFO of $56.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share, which compares to core FFO of $55.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2021.
We now expect 2022 core FFO to range between $0.83 and $0.85 per fully diluted share.
Same-store cash operating expenses and real estate taxes in the third quarter were $71.5 million, an increase of $7.1 million from second quarter levels and an $8.9 million increase from the third quarter of 2021 due to real estate taxes, utilities, labor and repair and maintenance related to increased utilization.
We expect to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and redeploy the proceeds in 1031 transaction.
I'm pleased to provide comments on a solid quarter that emphasizes the competitive strength of our portfolio comprised of quality office assets at accessible price points, the Empire State Building Observatory, the #1 attraction in the United States, strong everyday retail assets with 95% national retail tenancy and our well-located, amenitized multifamily assets.
We continue to anticipate same-store operating expenses for the full year of 2022 will run about 7% below pre-pandemic levels due to a combination of earlier permanent cost-saving measures and gradual return to office through the year.
Within this revised 2022 core FFO range, we now expect 2022 Observatory NOI to be approximately $67 million to $70 million compared to $74 million to $77 million.
We have 4 revenue streams.
Looking ahead to 2023, we have manageable upcoming lease expirations with only 5.5% or 540,000 square feet expiring in 2023, of which we expect to vacate about 280,000 square feet to vacate and 98,000 square feet of tenants who are undecided.
Blended lease spreads signed at our Manhattan office properties improved to a positive 10% on a cash basis compared to prior escalated rents driven by new leases up 23.6%.
We expect same-store occupancy to be between 84% and 86% by year-end, up from 82.4% at year-end 2021.
In line with our 2022 earnings outlook, same-store property cash NOI, excluding lease termination fees, was down 7.5% year-over-year, primarily due to the normalization of operating expenses amid higher building utilization as well as the impact from the occupancy loss of GBG in late 2021.
We also signed leases for 16 pre-built office suites in Manhattan, and we've had good success leasing our pre-built this year and are on pace to match our annual average pre-built leased between 2017 and 2019.
Occupancy remained strong at 98.4%, and we continue to see strong mark-to-market increases, reduced concessions, which will validate our earlier investment decision.
Our strong and flexible balance sheet with no floating rate debt exposure and a well-laddered maturity schedule with no debt maturity for the next 2 years makes us very well positioned to allocate capital strategically.
Consistent with our expectations, which we communicated during the last earnings call, the total commercial portfolio leased percentage was up 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter to 88.5%.
