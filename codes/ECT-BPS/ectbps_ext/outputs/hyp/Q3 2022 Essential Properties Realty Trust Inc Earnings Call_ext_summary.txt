Lastly, I'll reiterate that our current investment pipeline outlook for the core portfolio and our continued strong performance this quarter provided us with the basis to maintain our 2022 AFFO per share guidance range of $1.52 to $1.54, which as we've previously noted, implies a 14% year-over-year growth rate at the midpoint.
We are establishing 2023 AFFO per share guidance at $1.58 to $1.64, which implies 5% growth midpoint to midpoint.
Among the headlines last night was our AFFO per share, which on a fully diluted per share basis was $0.38, it's an increase of 15% versus Q3 2021.
Lastly, as Pete mentioned in our release last night, we issued our AFFO per share guidance for 2023 at a range of $1.58 to $1.64, which implies a 3% to 7% growth at the low and high ends of the range relative to the midpoint of our 2022 AFFO per share guidance.
We also reported last night that our AFFO per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, totaled $1.15 per share on a fully diluted per share basis , which is a 19% increase over the same period in 2021.
This earnings growth projection relative to the double-digit growth experienced over the last 2 years, mostly results from our measured external growth outlook, current volatility in the capital markets and underlying investment spreads.
With quarter-end leverage of 4.4x and liquidity of nearly $900 million, our balance sheet is well capitalized for continued investments.
On a nominal basis, our FFO totaled $53.5 million for the quarter, up $13.3 million over the same period in 2021, an increase of nearly 33% and up nearly 6% compared to the preceding second quarter of 2022.
We are committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet and investors should expect us to remain well within our historical leverage range of 4.5x to 5.5x.
As our third quarter results indicate, our portfolio continues to perform at a high level with record-level unit level coverage of 4.2x, same-store rent growth of 1.7% and just 3 vacant properties.
We expect this positive trend among our lowest coverage cohorts to continue as these statistics still remain negatively skewed by our trailing 12-month reporting convention, which lags our own reporting by 1 or 2 quarters.
In terms of dispositions, we sold 12 properties this quarter for $35.5 million in net proceeds at a 6.2% weighted average cash yield with a weighted average unit level coverage of 1.2x.
During the third quarter, we invested $195 million through 27 separate transactions at a weighted average cash yield of 7.1%, which was up 10 basis points versus the prior quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we have closed $60 million of investments to date, and our pipeline remains active at increasingly higher cap rates.
We ended the quarter with investments in 1,572 properties that were 99.8% leased to 329 tenants operating in 16 industries.
Our weighted average lease term stood at 14 years with only 4.2% of our ABR expiring through 2026.
