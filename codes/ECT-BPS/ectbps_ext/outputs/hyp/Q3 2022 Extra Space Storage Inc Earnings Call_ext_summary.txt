After these adjustments, we have tightened our core FFO range, which is now estimated to be between $8.30 and $8.40 per share and implied increase of approximately 21% year-over-year.
Core FFO includes an add-back of $0.05 per share for estimated property damage and tenant insurance claims related to Hurricane Ian.
We had another strong quarter with same-store revenue growth of 15.5%, driven by strong rental rate growth, partially offset by lower year-over-year occupancy.
This revision results in a $0.05 or a 60 basis point decrease at the midpoint of our FFO range.
We had a strong third quarter, $0.01 ahead of our own internal FFO projections.
Fundamentals remain strong, just not as off the [chart] strong as they have been in the last 6 quarters.
We felt expense pressure across many line items, resulting in total same-store expense growth of 12.6% and same-store NOI growth of 16.4%.
We still anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions in C of O stores in line with last quarter's estimate.
Given our total investment activity year-to-date, we've increased our acquisition investment guidance to $1.65 billion, all of which is closed or under contract.
In the third quarter of 2021, we had same-store payroll expense of negative 9% and property tax growth of negative 4.5% which drove total Q3 2021 expense growth of negative 4%.
We capitalized the Storage Express transaction with $125 million in OP units at an average price per share of $201.84, with the remainder drawn on the revolving credit facility.
The revolver draws caused our variable rate debt to exceed our typical range of 20% to 30% of total debt at quarter end.
Our implied 2022 FFO growth at the midpoint is 21%.
If we evaluate our third quarter expenses on a 2-year stack, average payroll expense growth was approximately 5.2%, average property tax expense growth was 3.1%, and total -- and average total annual same-store expense grew 4.2% a year.
Our strong property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 19.5%.
We continue to be busy on the external growth front, adding 40 stores gross to our third-party management platform, closing over $100 million in bridge loans in closing a number of acquisitions, most notably the purchase of Storage Express.
