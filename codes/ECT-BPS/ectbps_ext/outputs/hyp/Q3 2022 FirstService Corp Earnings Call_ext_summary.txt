Our adjusted earnings per share was $1.17, down from a reported $1.50 from Q3 last year, which included a $0.21 per share gain on sale from a noncore business.
For the current third quarter, FirstService recorded total revenues of $960 million, up 13%, and adjusted EBITDA came in at $95.5 million, up 1% relative to the prior year period.
Total revenues for the quarter were up 13% over the prior year with organic revenue growth at 8%, balanced about evenly between our 2 divisions, EBITDA for the quarter was $95.5 million, up modestly from 2021, reflecting a margin of 9.9% compared to 11.1% in the prior year.
So earnings per share down modestly year-over-year against a normalized $1.29 after adjusting for this prior year gain.
I'll now dive further into our third quarter segmented results for our 2 divisions.
And lastly, our adjusted earnings per share year-to-date is $3.02, down from $3.36 reported for the same period last year.
In terms of our outlook for closing out 2022, our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter will see low double-digit to mid-teens percentage growth over Q4 2021, including the assumption of realizing roughly $70 million of hurricane work, as Scott mentioned.
At FirstService Residential, revenues were up 13% with organic growth over 8%.
Highlighting our consolidated performance for the 9 months year-to-date, we have delivered revenues of $2.73 billion, up from $2.39 billion in the prior year period, an increase of 14%, which includes 8% organic growth.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect to again show some sequential growth from Q3 and year-over-year increases of about 15% against a strong fourth quarter in 2021.
We did not book any revenues during the quarter from named storms or area-wide events and are pleased that we were able to match prior year revenues that included $30 million primarily from Hurricane Ida.
Century had another strong quarter, growing by over 20%, half organic.
Earlier this week, we were excited to announce the addition of 3 companies to our restoration platforms.
At this point, our best estimate is that restoration will show about 20% revenue growth in Q4 relative to the prior year.
Again, this quarter, we estimate the price accounted for between 2% and 3% of the quarterly gain.
