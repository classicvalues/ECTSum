Last night, we reported FFO per share of $0.54 for the third quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 1.9% versus the $0.53 per share we reported in the third quarter of 2021.
For the quarter, FFO and net income were $0.50 and $0.27 per share, respectively.
Additionally, as a result of our year-to-date investment in capital activities, we are raising our 2022 AFFO guidance to a range of $2.12 to $2.13 per share.
And finally, with respect to our 2022 earnings, as a result of our year-to-date investment in capital markets activities, we are raising our AFFO per share guidance to a range of $2.12 to $2.13 from our previous range of $2.10 to $2.12.
Our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO increased 6.7% and our AFFO per share grew to $0.54.

Returning to our $150 million committed investment pipeline and associated financing.
Brian will elaborate further in his remarks, but we have already raised or identified funding for approximately 75% of this transaction activity at costs meaningfully inside of prevailing market rates.
We expect to fund these transactions throughout the next 12 months or so with the average initial yields of approximately 20 basis points in access where we have closed acquisitions year-to-date.
During the quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements to sell 714,000 common shares through our ATM program at $30.22 per share, which will generate gross proceeds of $21.6 million.
We continue to underwrite a variety of potential investment opportunities during the quarter with convenience stores representing 58% of the underwritten volume and other convenience and automotive retail sectors representing the balance.
Looking ahead, regarding the $150 million of commitments to fund acquisitions and developments that Chris referenced, while we have fully executed agreements for each transaction, the timing and amount of each investment is ultimately dependent on our counterparties and the schedules under which they are able to complete development projects and close certain business acquisitions.
Our net environmental remediation spending in the quarter was approximately $825,000.
The dedicated efforts of our team have led to a net increase in our committed investment pipeline to more than $150 million from the acquisition and development of new-to-industry convenience stores, auto service centers and car wash properties, which we expect to fund over the next year or so.
