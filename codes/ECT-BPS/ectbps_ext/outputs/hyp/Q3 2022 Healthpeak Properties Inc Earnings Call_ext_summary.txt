For the third quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.43 per share and total portfolio same-store growth of 5.1%.
We are increasing the midpoint of our FFO as adjusted guidance by $0.02 to $1.73, and we have tightened the guidance range to $1.72 to $1.74.

Very purposefully, we were not aggressive on acquisitions or new development starts in the past 18 months.
For the third quarter, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share.
In Life Sciences, same-store growth was a very solid 5.4%, and we finished the quarter with an occupancy rate of 99%.
We also expect to have a little bit bigger box to play going forward, but still within our 2 core segments.
Additionally, we are increasing the midpoint of our blended same-store guidance by 75 basis points, and we have tightened the guidance range to 4.5% to 5.5%.

We had another fantastic quarter with same-store growth of 4.9%.
To that end, we're advancing entitlements across all 3 of our life science markets.
Our preference is to raise public equity at accretive prices and own assets 100%, but that approach isn't always available.
