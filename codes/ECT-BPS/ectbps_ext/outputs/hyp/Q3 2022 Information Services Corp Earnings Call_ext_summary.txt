Net income was $7.8 million or $0.44 per basic and $0.43 per diluted share compared to $9.7 million or $0.56 per basic share and $0.54 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2021.
And with all of that in mind, we're reiterating our annual guidance for 2022 for revenue to be between $188 million and $193 million; net income to be between $29 million and $33 million and EBITDA to be between $59 million and $64 million, and we expect to finish the year around the middle of those ranges.
Revenue was $48.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% compared to the third quarter of 2021.
Compared to our cash position of $27.2 million at the end of the second quarter, you can see that our cash position continues to grow and provides for debt repayment due to the strong free cash flow nature of our business.
This was offset by a $1 million decline in land registry revenue during the quarter as Saskatchewan real estate levels returned to more normalized seasonal levels.
This was due to continued transaction and customer growth and services, specifically in the Corporate Solutions division, along with $1.6 million of revenue contributed from the UPLevel business that was acquired in February of this year.
EBITDA, earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, was $15.8 million compared to $17.5 million for the same quarter in 2021 due to increases in people and technology costs and increases in share-based compensation, partially offset by increased revenue overall, and in particular, EBITDA contributed from acquisitions made earlier in the year.
The decrease in net income is due to increases in people and technology costs, accompanied by $1.4 million in increased share-based compensation from increases in the company's share price during the quarter compared to a quarter-over-quarter decrease in the prior year.
Registry Operation's newest division, Property Tax Services acquired through the Reamined acquisition on June 1, 2022, also contributed to the increased revenue for the quarter in the amount of $3.8 million.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $11.6 million, a decrease of 13% compared to the third quarter of 2021.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.9% compared to 41.8% in 2021, with the change coming from increased services revenue at a lower margin and lower revenue overall in the land registry in the quarter.
After all of this, as of September 30, 2022, we held $32.9 million in cash compared to $40.1 million as at December 31, 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million for the quarter compared to $17.3 million in 2021.
This increase was a result of additional borrowings related to the acquisition of Reamined in the prior quarter, but was offset by a $5 million prepayment to our facility during the current period.
With respect to our debt, as of September 30, 2022, the company had $76.5 million of total debt outstanding compared to $41 million as at December 31, 2021.
EBITDA margin was 32.5% for the quarter compared to 42.3% in 2021.
