Yesterday, InvenTrust reported core FFO of $82.9 million or $1.23 per share, representing an increase of 21% for the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period last year.
Moving on to our guidance, we are raising our core FFO range to $1.57 to $1.60.
We've continued to execute on our stated goals throughout the last 12 months, one of which is moving our portfolio concentration closer to 100% Sun Belt by sourcing attractive grocery-anchored acquisitions in our target markets while opportunistically rotating out of our non-Sun Belt assets.
We are maintaining our pro rata same-property NOI growth guidance at 4% to 5%.
The increase was largely driven by pro rata same-property NOI contributing $0.08 per share, an additional $0.03 from 2022 acquisitions.
In addition, we realized G&A savings of $0.09 due to recurring and non-recurring cost reduction as well as a positive $0.07 impact from our $100-million share repurchase in Q4 of last year.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $575 million of total liquidity, including $350 million of borrowing capacity available on our credit facility.
These gains were offset by an increase in interest expense of $0.07.
Approximately 87% of our debt is fixed rate.
Anchor tenant ABR was $12.39 with small-shop ABR hitting $31.91, both increases over Q2 of 2022 and Q3 of 2021.
InvenTrust owns 11 properties in Florida and seven in North Carolina, all near the path of the storm.
Our leased occupancy ended the first nine months of the year at 95.6%, 210 basis points above the same time period last year.
Our pro rata weighted average interest rate is 3.8%, and our weighted average maturity is 4.9 years.
Removing this out-of-period rent from the comparison periods, pro rata same-property NOI would have increased 0.8% for the quarter and 6.6% year to date.
For the quarter, we signed 83 leases, representing 478,000 square feet from various retail categories.
For the third quarter and year to date, InvenTrust opened up 120,000 and 225,000 square feet of space, respectively.
