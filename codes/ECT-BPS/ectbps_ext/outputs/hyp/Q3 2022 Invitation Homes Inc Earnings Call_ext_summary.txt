Our revised full year guidance for 2022 is consistent with our prior expectations for the overall business with 2 exceptions: property taxes and bad debt.
Core FFO increased 9.5% year-over-year to $0.42 per share, primarily due to an increase in NOI, driven by strong rent growth and demand for our homes.
This drove an 8.2% year-over-year increase in AFFO to $0.34 per share.
Our same-store net operating income grew 8.6% year-over-year.
Same-store core revenue growth was 8.3%, primarily driven by a 9.6% increase in average monthly rent and a 15.5% increase in other income.
The sequential decrease from the second quarter reflects our expected return to a more normal seasonality patterns that have otherwise been absent the past 2 years.
Our updated acquisition assumption for the full year is $1.1 billion.
We expect new lease rate growth for this month to come in at 9% or better and renewal increases to come in at 10% or better.
And through the third quarter, we've acquired approximately $1 billion of that target.
It was a solid quarter for Invitation Homes with same-store NOI growth of 8.6%, blended lease rate growth of 11.6% and average occupancy of 97.5%.
I'd like to point out the following 2 nonrecurring items included in our third quarter reconciliation of reported FFO to core FFO.
This resulted in blended rent growth of 11.6% or 100 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021.
These advantages further fan the favorable tailwinds of demographics, especially among millennials who are just beginning to approach our average resident age of 39 years old.
Our same-store average occupancy was 97.5% for the third quarter.
New lease rates grew 15.6%, and renewal rates grew 10.2%.
We sent out renewals for November and December in the mid-10% range.
