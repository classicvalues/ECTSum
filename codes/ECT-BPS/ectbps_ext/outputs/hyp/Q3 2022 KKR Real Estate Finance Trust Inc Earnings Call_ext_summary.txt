For the third quarter of 2022, we reported GAAP net income of negative $48.4 million, or negative $0.70 per diluted share.
Distributable earnings this quarter were $34.4 million, or $0.50 per share.
To put this in context, we have stated in our supplement that a 100-basis point increase in base rates from 3.04% at quarter-end would result in an increase of $0.21 in annualized distributable earnings per share based on our 9/30 portfolio, with all else being equal.
Over the last 2 reported quarters and subsequent to quarter-end, we have been opportunistic in utilizing our share repurchase program, with year-to-date purchases of 2.1 million shares for a total of $36 million.
This was driven by an increase in our CECL allowance, by $1.16 per share, to $1.66 per share.
Our debt-to-equity ratio was 1.9x, and total leverage ratio was 3.6x as of quarter-end, and we expect to maintain total leverage in the mid-3s over the coming quarters.
Finally, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price per share of $17.42 in Q3, for a total of over $10 million.
Book value per share as of September 30, 2022, was $18.28, a decline of 5.6% quarter-over-quarter.
KREF generated another quarter of strong distributable earnings of $0.50 per share, equating to greater than 1.1x dividend coverage ratio.
Our approach to managing the balance sheet allowed us to start the fourth quarter with a record level of liquidity in excess of $900 million.
This quarter, we recorded an increase in our CECL reserve of $81 million, to $115 million, or 156 basis points based on the funded loan portfolio.
As the CLO market has cooled over the past 9 months and the spreads in the CLO market have widened, our mix of alternative sources of financing away from some of the more public capital market sources remains a major differentiator for KREF.
In response to this, we have materially increased our CECL reserve and added 3 loans to our watch list, for a total of 5 loans.
Specifically, in the third quarter, with the help of our partners in KKR Capital Markets, we entered into a new $266 million bespoke nodal note financing facility in connection with one of our loan originations, and we completed a second upsize on one of our existing matched-term financing facilities from $750 million to $1 billion.
In addition, we now have 2 loans which are risk-rated at 5 and have increased our dialogue with those sponsors.
That leaves us today with over $900 million of liquidity, which does not include $370 million of unlevered senior loans on the balance sheet.
