During the quarter, GAAP earnings per share totaled $0.12 a share.
Adjusted net income, which adds back noncash expenses, such as depreciation, totaled $69 million or approximately $0.50 per share.
Year-to-date, we've generated GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 per share, adjusted net income of $196 million, or approximately $1.43 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $444 million.
These include organically growing our multifamily net operating income, further expansion of our debt and industrial portfolios and the near-term completion of our $3 billion development pipeline, which is expected to produce $92 million of incremental NOI to KW, 83% of which we expect to be stabilized by the end of 2024.
These areas of growth should meaningfully add to our $473 million of estimated annual NOI, which is up 9% for the year and up 15% from Q3 of '21; and to our $5.6 billion of fee-bearing capital, which has increased by 12% for the year and by almost 50% in the last 2 years.
And with almost $4 billion of unspent nondiscretionary committed capital in our announced platforms, we continue to evaluate ways of taking advantage of the new opportunities that may present themselves in the next 12 to 18 months.
We have minimal debt maturities in 2023 totaling $311 million, approximately 60% of which we currently plan to pay off using asset sales and existing cash.
Our dispositions totaled $683 million in the quarter.
We continue to see further improvement in our consolidated quarterly revenue, which is up 22% year-over-year and almost 3% on a sequential basis.
Given that 86% of the loans are floating rate, rising rates have improved the earnings, which are a combination of interest and asset management fees from our debt platform, from the low teens initially to high teens today unlevered.
We currently have additional capacity of $3 billion in capital to continue growing this business as opportunities arise.
Post quarter end, we completed another $165 million of new originations, bringing our platform to $2.6 billion in loan investments, of which KW holds a 7% interest.
As of September 30, 2022, 97% of our debt remains either fixed or hedged, and we have also hedged 87% of the carrying value of our European investments.
This strong demand in structural undersupply of housing bodes well for the approximately 1,000 units which we will start delivering next year in Dublin.
Roughly 2/3 of our NOI are from sectors where we are seeing strong cash flow growth, which include our apartment and logistics business, along with our loan portfolio in the Shelbourne Hotel.
And as part of this acquisition, we assumed debt with a fixed rate of 3.64% with 7 years left to maturity.
