Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted funds from operations of $1.73 per share for the quarter, an increase of 26.3% over the same quarter last year and well above the high end of our guidance.
As a result of these strong operating fundamentals, we achieved adjusted funds from operations of $1.73 per share for the quarter, which is 26.3% increase over last year.
Based on this outlook, we now anticipate core FFO per share for 2022 to be between $6.42 and $6.46 and or 27% growth over the prior year at the midpoint.
As we look towards the full year, we now estimate our adjusted funds from operations per share to increase to a midpoint of $6.44 for the year, which would be 27% growth from 2021.
We now expect same-store revenue to grow greater than our past guidance to between 14.25% and 15.25%, which will be driven by improved rental rates.
To highlight a few notable results and trends from the quarter, we achieved a same-store revenue growth of 14.9% for the quarter over last year.
Third quarter same-store revenue increased 14.9% over the third quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increasing rental rates.
Same-store NOI growth this quarter is 18.4% higher than the same quarter a year ago.
This increase should result in a greater same-store NOI growth that we now expect to be between 18% to 19%.
As Joe noted, this is the continuation of double-digit rate growth for the last 5 quarters.
That puts us at 5 quarters in a row with same-store NOI growth of 18% or greater.
We continue to see strong and balanced revenue performance across our entire portfolio with 94% of our major markets achieving quarterly double-digit revenue growth for 5 quarters in a row.
We continue to have no significant debt maturities until April of 2024 when $175 million becomes due.
We view these acquisitions as complementary to our existing portfolio, and 4 of these properties are coming from our third-party management platform.
The net effect of that same-store revenue and expense performance was a 214 basis point expansion in our quarterly same-store net operating income margin to 72.8%, resulting in year-over-year growth in same-store NOI of 18.4% for the third quarter.
Payroll and benefits increased less than 1% over the third quarter of 2021 on a same-store basis.
