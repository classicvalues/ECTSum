Today, we did increase our 2022 core FFO per share guidance from a range of $3.07 to $3.12 per share to a new range of $3.11 to $3.15 per share.
Based on our year-to-date performance, we announced a further increase in our 2022 guidance of core FFO to a range of $3.11 to $3.15 per share.
And similarly, we increased the AFFO guidance to a range of $3.18 to $3.22 per share.
That's up $0.08 or 11.3% over year ago results of $0.71 per share.
Today, we also reported that AFFO per share was $0.81 per share for the third quarter, and that's up $0.06 per share or 8% over prior year results.
The year-to-date 9-month core FFO results were $2.35 per share, and that's an 11.4% increase over year ago results.
Job 1 is always to re-lease the vacancies but we will continue to sell nonperforming assets if we do not see a clear path of generating rental income within a reasonable time frame.
At the end of the quarter, we had under $50 million drawn on our $1.1 billion line of credit after completing over $585 million of volume through the first 9 months of the year.
Current 2022 core FFO guidance is suggesting about 9% growth to the midpoint with some tailwinds that put us above our typical growth rate.
Our credit facility has plenty of capacity, as I mentioned earlier, with only a balance of under $50 million.
We also collected 99.7% of rent due for the third quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, 82.1% or $46.6 million of the original $56.7 million deferred rents being paid back, which is 100% that is due at the time.
The guidance midpoints for both the core FFO and AFFO were increased by $0.035 or 1.1% compared to the prior quarter guidance.
Our weighted average debt maturity is now approximately 14 years.
Interest coverage and fixed charge coverage of 4.7x for the third quarter.
Our next debt maturity is $350 million with a 3.9% coupon in mid-2024.
