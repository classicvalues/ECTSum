We delivered another great quarter with growth in core FFO per share of 26.3% and same-store NOI growth of 12.1%.
The combination of these factors results in us adjusting the midpoint of our core FFO per share guidance down by $0.015 to $2.81.
The updated range is $2.80 to $2.82.
As a result, for the full year 2022, we estimate same-store revenue growth of 11.5% to 12.5%, a tighter range than previous guidance while keeping the midpoint of 12%.
The third quarter increase in same-store OpEx is due primarily to a 6.1% increase in property taxes driven by Texas, Georgia and Florida, a 12.4% increase in utilities and a 28.6% increase in marketing spend.
Our third quarter growth of 6.9% reflected inflationary pressures that we're seeing across the economy as well as property taxes driven by significant increases in self-storage property values.
Third quarter same-store NOI increased 12.1% over last year, driven by a 10.7% increase in revenue combined with a 6.9% increase in property operating expenses.
Additionally, the rapid rise in interest rates is pressuring interest expense, which combined with an income tax charge during the third quarter, will weigh on core FFO per share by approximately $0.02 for full year 2022.
We ended the third quarter with a same-store occupancy of 92.6%, down 350 basis points compared to the prior year.
This continued robust year-over-year growth was driven by a combination of double-digit same-store growth and our healthy acquisition volume over the past 4 quarters.
At quarter end, our leverage was 6x net debt to EBITDA, right in the middle of our targeted range of 5.5 or 6.5x.
Same-store occupancy averaged 94.1% for the quarter, down 240 basis points compared to last year.
Expense growth of 5.5% to 6.5% up from the previous range of 5% and 6.25% and NOI growth of 14% to 15%, with the midpoint of 14.5% or 50 basis points below the prior midpoint.
We acquired 23 wholly owned properties, investing $322 million at an average cap rate of 5.4%.
Repairs and maintenance grew 4.1%, while personnel costs grew just 2.6%.
We are very comfortable with our balance sheet with no maturities through 2022 and $375 million scheduled to mature in 2023, $300 million of which consists of 2 term loans that we will address over the few months.
