The company's third quarter revenue was $116.2 million, up 26.4% from $91.9 million in the third quarter of 2021 with a net loss of $56.5 million incurred in the quarter.
Third quarter AFFO was $34.2 million or $0.26 per share, up 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, the last full quarter prior to the CIM transaction.
AFFO per share was $0.26.
Our third quarter 2022 FFO was $29.4 million or $0.22 per share and NOI was $88.1 million, a 12.2% increase over the $78.5 million of NOI we reported in the third quarter of 2021.
During the first 9 months of the year, we disposed of over $330 million of mostly non-core properties and have a disposition pipeline of over $250 million, assuming all dispositions close on their contemplated terms.
Most notably, we grew AFFO per share by 18% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, the last full quarter prior to the CIM portfolio transaction.
Our executed leases as of quarter end plus leasing pipeline as of October 31 would raise occupancy in our multi-tenant segment to 92.8%, up from 89.4% at the end of the second quarter, as executed leases commence and assuming all of the signed letters of intent lead to definitive leases.
For the first time since 1995, more stores opened and closed in the U.S. last year with that trend expected to continue in 2022, even in the face of possible economic headwinds.
As of the quarter end, the tenants of our single tenant assets are over 54% actual or implied investment-grade rated, and 40.4% of anchor tenants in our multi-tenant portfolio are actual or implied investment-grade rated.
We had an excellent third quarter highlighted by leasing over 1 million square feet, including new leases and lease renewals, and completing the CIM portfolio acquisition.
Retail vacancy fell to its lowest level in 15 years in the second quarter of this year, while asking rents at U.S. shopping centers were 16% higher than 5 years ago.
This includes over 500,000 square feet through 41 new leases in our multi-tenant portfolio with $3.5 million of annualized straight-line rent and over 550,000 square feet on 42 lease renewals in our multi-tenant portfolio, representing $8.4 million in annualized straight-line rent.
Based on straight-line rent, 63.9% of leases across the portfolio include contractual rent increases, which increased the cash that is due under these leases over time by approximately 1% per year on average.
The company distributed $28.3 million in common dividends to shareholders in the quarter or $0.21 per share.
This consists of 70 new leases totaling almost 800,000 square feet and over $6.5 million in annualized straight-line rent and 98 lease renewals totaling over 1.1 million square feet and $16.5 million in annualized straight-line rent.
At quarter end, our long-term debt had a weighted average maturity of 4.3 years and with 83% fixed rate after we proactively locked in rates during the historically low interest rate environment we experienced last year, which insulates us from significant exposure to today's rising interest rate environment.
