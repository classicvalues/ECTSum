As stated in our earnings release, we're narrowing our AFFO per share guidance range to $1.15 to $1.17 per share.
At the same time, the positive investment decisions we have made, the limited operating risk associated with our current tenant lineup, and our ability to lock in significant portions of our capital structure in the third quarter allow us to narrow our AFFO per share guidance range to $1.15 to $1.17 per share, resulting in a small increase in our midpoint of expectations.
During the quarter, we completed $130 million of net investment activity, closed on both our second forward equity offering of 10.35 million shares and our $600 million sustainability-linked credit facility, locking in attractively priced capital before the latest interest rate hikes and heightened market volatility.
We did not settle any of the 10.35 million shares from our August forward equity offering and did not make any sales under our ATM program during the quarter.
The new credit facility includes a $400 million revolver that matures in August 2026, subject to an extension option, and replaces our previous $250 million revolver.
Cash G&A is expected to remain in the range of $14.5 million to $15 million, which is inclusive of transaction costs.
In addition, we would like to highlight that in a lending environment where banks are being significantly more selective, Net Street was able to secure 3 new banking relationships, giving further credence to our strategy and growth initiatives.
Similar to our last 2 offerings, the deal was upsized, and underwriters exercised the shoe, demonstrating the continued support from investors on our strategy and execution.
And lastly, the full-year 2022 diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which includes the impact of OCI units, is updated from our previously stated 50 million to 52 million shares to now be in the range of 50 million to 51 million shares.
On September 29, we settled all 4.5 million remaining shares from the January forward equity offering, receiving net proceeds of $93.5 million.
Our cash interest expense expectation has been narrowed from our previously stated $7 million to $9 million to $8 million to $9 million.
With regard to our dividend, earlier this week, the Board declared a $0.20 regular quarterly cash dividend to be payable on December 15 to shareholders of record as of December 1.
Noncash compensation expense is expected to remain in the range of $5 million to $5.5 million.
Following our equity deal, we completed a new $600 million sustainability-linked credit facility.
Interest expense increased to $3 million from $895,000 in the third quarter of 2021 due to higher borrowing costs and increased debt balances.
G&A increased to $4.6 million in the third quarter compared to $3.8 million from third quarter 2021, primarily due to building out our team to 32 employees.
