Due to the macro factors discussed, we incurred an un-depreciated loss per share of $0.27 and un-depreciated book value decline of 8.3%, ending the third quarter at $3.89.
As Jason mentioned earlier, un-depreciated book value per share ended at $3.89, down 8.3% from June 30 and translated to a negative 5.9% economic return on un-depreciated book value during the quarter.
We had GAAP net interest income of $14.2 million or $0.04 per share for the quarter.
The company had un-depreciated loss per share of $0.27 in the third quarter.
We're seeing a 15% to 30% discount to current values being priced in some market and very little trading.
In all, we repurchased 5.5 million shares at an average price of $2.62 during the third quarter.
So we feel we're fairly confident that we'll be able to produce further gains in this portfolio and hence, the reason why we're looking to monetize these 19 assets.
It looks like sellers want to sell at 15% discount and buyers want to buy at a 30% discount to current values in the single-family rental markets.
This is something we are very adept at doing and have various amounts of experience over 2 decades managing discounted assets to trust environments and look forward to optimizing our portfolio in that environment.
During the quarter, we opportunistically disposed off investment securities in our portfolio, generating in total realized gains of $20.6 million or $0.05 per share.
The yield on the 2-year treasury increased to 4.22% at the end of the quarter, an increase of 349 basis points from last year.
A $100 million unsecured fixed, which is due in 2026, and 2 junior subordinated debt deals that are due in 2035.
We have 3 bonds that are standing on our balance sheet today.
Company recourse leverage of 0.5x is the result.
While our financing costs were higher in the third quarter due to rising interest rates, the contribution of adjusted net interest income to earnings per share during the quarter was at the same level as a year ago at $0.08 per share as a result of our low utilization of leverage.
Thus far, in 2022, equity markets have been challenged with the Fed's decision to raise interest rates by 75 basis points in 4 consecutive meetings, taking the federal funds rate to its highest point since 2008 with expected additional rate hikes in the upcoming months, alongside of a growth -- growing concerns of a potential near-term recession.
