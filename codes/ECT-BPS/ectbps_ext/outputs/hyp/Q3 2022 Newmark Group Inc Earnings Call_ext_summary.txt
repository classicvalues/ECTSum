Our earnings per share was $0.35 compared with $0.50 last year.
Against the backdrop of lower industry-wide investment sales volumes and declining origination activity, our revenues were down 15.7% to $664.6 million compared with $788.1 million.
We expect total revenues of between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion compared with [$2.9064 billion.]
Our meaningful scale with low leverage and strong cash flow, together with our $600 million revolving credit facility leaves us well positioned to invest in growth as we execute our 2025 plan.
We anticipate adjusted EBITDA of between $500 million and $550 million versus $597.5 million.
This quarter's $0.35 was our second best third-quarter ever and $0.03 ahead of 2019.
As a result, our total revenues declined by 16%.
During the quarter, we repurchased 10.1 million shares for $10.35 per share.
We expect our adjusted earnings tax rate to be approximately 19% compared with 18.9% and we anticipate weighted average share count declined by 6% to 7% compared with 264 million.
We are now #3 in the U.S. investment sales compared with #4 last year and #5 in 2017.

We also returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, reduced our net leverage by nearly 90% and continue to invest in our business.
With over $410 billion of global institutional real estate capital waiting to be deployed and $2.5 trillion of commercial and multifamily debt maturing over the next 5 years, we expect industry volumes to bounce back relatively quickly once U.S. interest rates are no longer rising and have stabilized.
