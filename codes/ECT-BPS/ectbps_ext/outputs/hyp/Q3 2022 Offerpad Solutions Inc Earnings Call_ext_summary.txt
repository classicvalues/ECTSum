In the third quarter, we generated $822 million of revenue, exceeding the top end of our Q3 guidance range and a 52% increase year-over-year.
Looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we expect to sell between 1,425 and 1,850 homes, generating revenue of between $500 million and $650 million.
We reported third quarter gross profit of $2.2 million, net loss of $80 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $64.3 million.
The diversification we have today has been thoughtfully and intentionally established over the last 7 years, supporting the resiliency of our business.
This increase was supported by the sale of 2,280 homes, reflecting a 36% year-over-year increase and an average sales price of $357,000 compared to $321,000 in the third quarter of 2021.
Right now, we are in between the seller's market and the buyer's market, and expectations between the 2 parties are vastly different.
We continue to expect an annual contribution margin after interest of 3% to 6% once the market stabilizes and to increase that margin over the longer term.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be between negative $40 million and negative $60 million, reflecting the continued near-term variability in market conditions.
To provide some historical context, in 2016, we were operating in only 4 markets.
Our presence in 28 markets across the country provides another risk mitigation opportunity.
In the third quarter, we maintained an average time from home acquisition to sell below 100 days, kept inventory aged over 180 days at 5% or 150 homes, earned a 93% customer satisfaction rating, and grew our listing and buyer closings by 100% year-over-year.
At that time, our largest market accounted for 84% of our revenue.
With gross margin profile of 31% year-to-date, we expect our listing service will continue to be an important product supporting our long-term gross margin target.
In the third quarter 2022, no market accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Revolutionizing a $2 trillion industry isn't easy, especially in times like today.
Sellers are holding on to the idea their home is still worth what it was 6 months ago, and buyers aren't willing to engage at those prices.
