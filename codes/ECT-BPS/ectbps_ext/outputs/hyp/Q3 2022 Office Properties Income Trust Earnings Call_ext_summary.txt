Normalized FFO for the third quarter was $53.8 million or $1.11 per share.
Looking forward to our normalized FFO and same-property cash basis NOI expectations in the fourth quarter, we expect normalized FFO to be between $1.08 and $1.10 per share.
For the full year 2022, we expect normalized FFO to be in the range of $4.71 and $4.73 per share.
Earlier this month, we declared our regular quarterly distribution of $0.55 per share, resulting in a normalized FFO payout ratio of 50% and a rolling 4-quarter CAD payout ratio of 67%.
Our results came in $0.01 below the low end of our guidance range, mainly driven by the timing of property dispositions.
Construction at our 20 Mass Ave development in Washington, D.C. is also on time and on budget.
As we progress on core initiatives, we remain focused on leasing operational efficiencies, development and capital recycling and are pleased with our portfolio position, which includes 63% of our rental income coming from investment-grade tenants, a portfolio average lease term of 6.3 years and a well-positioned balance sheet.
Our balance sheet remains well positioned with $629 million of total liquidity and no senior notes maturing until May 2024, which Matt will expand upon momentarily.
On average, lease terms for new and renewal leases are 11 years and 7 years, respectively, highlighted at GSA's commitment to properties within our portfolio.
We have minimal remaining lease expirations in 2022 with 80 basis points of annualized rental income expiring by year-end.
Nearly 4% of our 2023 expiring rental income has either signed subsequent to quarter end, or is in advanced stages of lease negotiations.
Year-to-date, dispositions totaled $196 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.8% and close to the high end of our 2022 guidance range.
We completed 606,000 square feet of new and renewal leasing, including a new lease for 84,000 square feet to anchor our Seattle life science development.
We reported a solid leasing momentum with 24 signed leases for 606,000 square feet, including a 21.6% weighted average roll-up in rent and a 7.2-year weighted average lease term.
In 2023, lease expirations represent approximately 14% of annualized rental income.
We are in active conversations with tenants that make up the remaining 2023 expiration and net known vacates for the year are trending between 3% and 5% of annualized rental income.
