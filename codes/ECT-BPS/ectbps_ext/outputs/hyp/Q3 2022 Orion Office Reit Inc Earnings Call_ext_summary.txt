Orion generated total revenues for the quarter of $51.8 million and reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $53 million or a loss of $0.94 per share.
Specifically, our core FFO is now expected to range from $1.76 to $1.78 per share, up from last quarter's increased range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share.
As a result of our solid performance for the first 9 months of 2022, and greater certainty in our estimates for the remainder of the year, we have raised the lower end of our core FFO guidance.
Core funds from operations was $24 million or $0.42 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was $32.1 million.
And to that point, they have approved a $50 million share repurchase program.
Importantly, the updated core FFO range should not be extrapolated to future years given the impact of lease expirations this year, coupled with anticipated expirations in the portfolio over the next 2 years and the associated expected decline in revenue due to a smaller portfolio size.
Our G&A is anticipated to range from $16 million to $16.5 million, consistent with the previous quarter.
The Orion Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be paid on January 17, 2023, to stockholders of record as of December 30, 2022.
And our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from 4.7x to 5.0x, also consistent with the previous quarter.
Notwithstanding the headwinds, our portfolio continues to have positive net cash flow and our available capital to execute on our business plan continues to grow with over $418 million in total liquidity.
Specifically, we had 2 scheduled lease expirations during the quarter, totaling about 49,000 square feet, and we had 10 vacant assets at quarter end, though our occupancy improved slightly from 86.4% last quarter to 88.2% this quarter, driven by our progress in selling vacant assets.
At quarter end, we owned 87 properties and 6 unconsolidated joint venture properties representing 10.1 million square feet that was 88.2% occupied.
Additionally, our portfolio's weighted average lease term declined slightly to 3.9 years.
We also have 4 additional properties totaling about 278,000 square feet under contract for sale for an aggregate sale price of approximately $15.9 million equating to a price per square foot of about $57.
To date, we have closed on 7 dispositions totaling 539,000 square feet for an aggregate sale price of $28.4 million equating to a price per square foot of approximately $53, both reducing existing vacancy and avoiding near term vacancy as the leases expire.
This year so far, we have completed about 500,000 square feet of renewal, expansion and new leases.
