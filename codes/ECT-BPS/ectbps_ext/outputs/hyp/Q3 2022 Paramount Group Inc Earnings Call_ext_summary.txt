We reported core FFO for the third quarter of $0.24 per share with slightly positive year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth.
And as a result, we are narrowing and maintaining the midpoint of our full year 2022 core FFO guidance of $0.97 per share.
Yesterday, we reported core FFO of $0.24 per share, in line with consensus estimates and $0.01 higher than the prior year's third quarter.
We continue to expect core FFO to be $0.97 per share at the midpoint and our expectation for same-store GAAP and cash NOI growth continues to be 4% and 2%, respectively, at the midpoint.
To date, we opportunistically repurchased 6.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $6.41 per share or $41.7 million in the aggregate.
And Midtown posted yet another quarter of positive net absorption during the third quarter, marking the fourth time in the past 5 quarters that Midtown has realized positive quarterly net absorption.
Our New York portfolio was currently 92.1% leased on a same-store basis at share, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 220 basis points year-over-year.
Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $3.67 billion at a weighted average interest rate of (technical difficulty) of 4.3 years.
We have no debt maturing in 2022 and roughly 5% of our share of debt maturing in 2023.
At quarter end, our same-store portfolio-wide leased occupancy rate at share was 91.4%, unchanged from last quarter and up 110 basis points year-over-year.
As has been the case since the pandemic began, we continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, which amounts to about $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter.
Looking ahead, our overall lease expiration profile in San Francisco is manageable with 0.4% at share expiring by year-end and 7.8% at share expiring per annum through 2024.
During the third quarter, we leased approximately 35,000 square feet at a weighted average term of 7.3 years with initial rents of approximately $114 per square foot.
87% of our debt is fixed and has a weighted average interest rate of 3.26%, and the remaining 13% is floating and has a weighted average interest rate of 5.39%.
Our third quarter leasing was New York driven and was highlighted by the 142,000 square foot lease with O'Melveny & Myers at 1301 Sixth Avenue, where they will take over 4 floors currently occupied by Credit Agricole which was set to expire in February 2023.
While our leasing volumes generally remain in line with historical norms, deals are taking longer to execute and, as such, we have reduced our full year 2022 leasing guidance by 100,000 square feet at the midpoint.
