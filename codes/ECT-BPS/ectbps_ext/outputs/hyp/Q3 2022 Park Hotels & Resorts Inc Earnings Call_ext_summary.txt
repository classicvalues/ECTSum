For the bottom line, we are establishing adjusted EBITDA guidance between $140 million and $155 million, translating to AFFO per share between $0.35 and $0.43 to for the quarter.
While it remains subject to Board approval, we currently expect the dividend to range between $0.21 and $0.26 per share, of which approximately $0.07 to $0.12 per share relates to distributions from operations.
And despite recent choppiness in the debt markets, interest in hotel real estate remains high, and we expect to execute on additional noncore asset sales, including potential deals in excess of $100 million, and these would bring our total net amount of closed and pending dispositions for the year to over $500 million, well within our expanded target discussed last quarter.
Pro forma RevPAR for the third quarter was $171, 8.8% below 2019 levels, driven by widespread improvements in demand, with pro forma occupancy improving sequentially by 80 basis points to 71.7% and pro forma rates continuing to improve to $239 for the quarter or 7% above the same period in 2019.
Also for the quarter, we remain laser-focused on our capital recycling priorities, and I'm pleased to report that we closed on 3 noncore asset sales since July for total proceeds of approximately $58 million, taking our year-to-date net proceeds to approximately $317 million from the sales of our interest in 7 hotels.
Overall, preliminary RevPAR for the month of October stands at $179 or less than 10% below 2019 levels.
For Q4, we are establishing RevPAR guidance of roughly $163 to $166 or 92% of 2019 levels at the midpoint.
We expect the positive momentum to continue into the fourth quarter, driven in large part by a healthy pickup in group business, while Q4 transient pace on the books is now 95% of 2019 levels on a pro forma basis, up from 83% reported 2 months ago.
In addition, we have initiated plans for full-scale renovation of the Casa Marina resort in Key West, a $70 million project, which will include a transformation of the public spaces and guest rooms and the addition of a new ocean-front restaurant.
And the remaining $0.14 per share relates to gains from assets sold this year.
Currently, group pace for 2023 increased to 75% of 2019 levels or 300 basis points higher than what we reported during the second quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, preliminary results in October look strong, with occupancy averaging approximately 74%, a nearly 200 basis point sequential improvement over September, while average daily rate during the month is projected to be approximately $243 or 4% above '19.
Third quarter pro forma RevPAR increased 62% year-over-year, having recovered to nearly 91% of 2019 levels.
Once closed, our liquidity position would exceed $2 billion, which we believe will give us the optionality to pivot between defense and offense during these uncertain economic times.
Our hotel adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to fall within a range of 24% to 25% or 470 basis points below 2019 at the midpoint.
Corporate negotiated revenue continued to improve across the portfolio for the quarter, increasing to 72% of 2019 levels compared to 64% last quarter, driven almost exclusively by occupancy gains.
