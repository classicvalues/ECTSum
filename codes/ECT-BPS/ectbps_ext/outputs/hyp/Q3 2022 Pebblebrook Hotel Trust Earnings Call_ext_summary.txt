Despite the impact of Hurricane Ian on our results, adjusted EBITDA was above the top end of our Q3 outlook by $1.5 million and adjusted funds from operations of $0.66 per share was $0.01 above the top end of our outlook.
So we've removed approximately $17.1 million in hotel revenues and $10.5 million in hotel EBITDA or $0.08 per share of FFO from our Q4 outlook.
Excluding the impact of LaPlaya due to the hurricane, our Q4 outlook would assume same-property RevPAR of down 1.6% to up 1.3% to Q4 2019, with adjusted EBITDA of $74.3 million to $82.3 million, which is roughly in line with 2019, if you add back LaPlaya's impact.
Based on our review of the resort and with our property adjusters and physical property experts, we currently estimate that the cost to remediate, repair, replace and clean up LaPlaya will be between $15 million and $25 million.
Overall it reduced our hotel revenues by approximately $2 million in September.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 is expected to be down 30% to 38% to Q4 '19 and up 45% to 63% to Q4 2021.
Our $650 million credit facility is completely undrawn, providing us with tremendous liquidity and flexibility.
We estimate that the property damage would be between $7 million and $9 million.
Fortunately we were well prepared and had a large third-party remediation crew positioned nearby who arrived with remediation equipment and a crew of 200 to start the inspections, cleanup, remediation and repairs the day after the hurricane hit.
From the proceeds of our recent property sales, positive operating cash flow and debt refinancing, we currently have approximately $120 million of cash.
Shifting to our capital improvement program, we remain on track to invest $100 million to $110 million into the portfolio in 2022, with over $80 million of it targeted for a number of ROI redevelopment projects, which we expect will generate cash and cash returns of 10% or higher when these transformed and re-merchandized hotels and resorts stabilize over the next 2 to 3 years.
This has allowed us to extend our debt maturities and increase the size of our unsecured revolver to $650 million, all while maintaining the same price on this debt as we had pre-pandemic.
Based on our recent trends, our current outlook for Q4 RevPAR is to be down 3% to flat to 2019 and up 32% to 36% to Q4 2021.
At LaPlaya, we expect that our business interruption insurance will cover all the losses after the estimated $1.7 million deductible for BI.
In the third quarter, our urban RevPAR was down 10.1% versus Q3 2019, and that compares to Q2's 17.7% shortfall.
Since it's reopening as a one, we've been averaging rates in the $480 to $580 range on a monthly basis.
