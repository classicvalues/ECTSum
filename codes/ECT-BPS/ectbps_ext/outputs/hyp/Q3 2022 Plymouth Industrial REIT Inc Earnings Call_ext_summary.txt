Core FFO per share was up 7% and AFFO per share was up 29%.
Same-store NOI on a GAAP basis was up 8.4% and up 11% on a cash basis.
The total investment of nearly $49 million is expected to generate initial yields in the 7% to 9% range.
We tightened the range of both the low and high ends, leaving us at $1.83 at the midpoint.
Based on these inputs, that would imply same-store NOI growth in Q4 of 8.5% to 10.5%.
This brings the percentage of our portfolio that is internally managed to about 70%.
Same-store NOI on a cash basis was up 11%.
Triple net leases now account for nearly 77% of same-store ABR as of quarter end, up from approximately 74% this time last year.
Finally, through November 1, we had collected 99.7% of our rents billed during Q3 2022, and there are currently no active rent deferrals.
Cash re-leasing spreads were 17.6%.
Pages 5 and 12 of our supplemental have more detail on the program and the pipeline, but I'll briefly bring you up to speed on the first phase.
The contribution from previous acquisitions, the raise in our annual same-store NOI range by 200 basis points and further refinement in G&A offset the higher interest expense on the credit facility and the higher share count from the earlier-than-expected conversion of the remaining Series B preferred shares into common shares.
Rent collections were well over 99%.
We are also assuming G&A expense controls will continue with an incremental $200,000 benefit from what we projected last quarter.
With the 2 new developments nearing completion in this market, we will be over 2 million square feet in Atlanta.
Most of this space, approximately 75% of it, is currently leased long term, and we're achieving returns of approximately 9.5% on a stabilized NOI for these repositionings.
