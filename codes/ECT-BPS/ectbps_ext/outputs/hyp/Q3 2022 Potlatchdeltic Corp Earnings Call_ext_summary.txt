Lumber futures are also back above $500 per thousand board feet.
While the amount depends on our performance for the remainder of the year, we expect the amount will be much lower than the $4 special dividend we paid last year.

Our sawlog harvest in the North increased from 276,000 tons in the second quarter to 459,000 tons in the third quarter.
The segment's adjusted EBITDDA increased from $58 million in the second quarter to $65 million in the third quarter.

At the end of Q3, we have $484 million of cash on the balance sheet, and liquidity of nearly $800 million.
