Core FFO was $1.73 per share, including $0.57 of net promote income earned principally from our PELP venture in Europe.
Finally, we are increasing core FFO, excluding Promotes, to $4.60 to $4.62 per share, which includes approximately $0.05 of accretion related to the acquisition of Duke.
Our annual guidance for Promotes was $0.60, with most of the revenue to be earned in the third quarter.
We are guiding core FFO with Promotes to be $5.12 to $5.14 per share, which incorporates a lower Promote guidance of $0.52, reflective of the higher share count resulting from the Duke transaction.
We now expect acquisitions to range between $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, which increased due to our acquisition activity in Europe during the quarter, and contributions and dispositions to range between $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
We've previously explained that we expect to see this metric climb into a low 30 months range, still at a level reflecting a strong operating environment.
Same-store growth was 8.3% on a net effective basis and 9.3% on a cash basis.
We fully integrated the portfolio, achieved our day 1 synergies and look forward to the next phase, which is to build AFFO accretion through incremental property cash flows and Essentials income.
We are maintaining our guidance for average occupancy, while increasing our net effective same-store guidance to 7.5% to 7.75%, and our cash same-store guidance to 8.5% to 8.75%.
With deployment, we are reducing our starts guidance to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect our fourth quarter starts will be 60% build-to-suit, reflecting a more cautious approach to deployment in the coming months, aiming to be very selective in new projects.
We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA of 4.3x, excluding gains, providing us significant investment capacity.
As for today, our true months of supply metrics sits at a healthy 22 months, up from 18 months last quarter.
Transaction gestation was stable during the third quarter at 62 days, proposals via available units slowed during the third quarter to levels more in line with the pace of 2019 and indicative of less urgency to renew space far ahead of exploration.
Ending occupancy increased 10 basis points over the quarter to 97.8%.
Inside our properties are metrics point of activity that is increasing with our IBI index at 63.8%, the 80th percentile and utilization up to 86.6%, the 95th percentile.
While we're reporting record results, including occupancy at 98.6% in a market with 2.4% vacancy, we are closely monitoring conditions.
