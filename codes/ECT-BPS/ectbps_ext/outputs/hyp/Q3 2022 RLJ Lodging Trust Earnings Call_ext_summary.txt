Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $92 million and adjusted FFO per share was $0.40.
And finally, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share.
We have been active under our share repurchase program so far this year, where we have repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares for $57 million at an average price of approximately $11.75 per share, including $7 million in share repurchases so far during the fourth quarter.
Our third quarter group revenues achieved 100% of 2019 levels, a significant post-pandemic milestone and a substantial improvement from 91% during the second quarter.
Relative to business transient, using our special corporate segment as a proxy, BT revenues relative to 2019 saw a 300 basis point improvement from the second quarter.
This enabled our group revenues to achieve 2019 levels during the third quarter, representing a 900 basis point improvement from the second quarter, and we were able to drive ADR to 108% of 2019, a 500 basis point improvement.
Additionally, the Board recently increased the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share starting with the recent third quarter dividend.
With respect to our operating performance, our hotels achieved 94% of 2019 RevPAR levels during the third quarter, a new high relative to 2019, led by our ability to continue to drive ADR, which achieved 105% of 2019 levels.
Our third quarter RevPAR was 94% of 2019 levels, which was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the quarter and was 96%, 90% and 98% of 2019 in July, August and September, respectively.
In October, many of the same urban markets that are driving the most significant ADR momentum are forecasted to generate ADR premiums of 10% to 20% over 2019, supported by near-term transient pace tracking above 2019 levels.
Forecasted October RevPAR of approximately $152 will be approximately 96% of 2019 levels.
Our third quarter portfolio occupancy was 72.7%, which was 90% of 2019 levels, an average daily rate was $189, exceeding pre-pandemic levels at 105% of 2019, representing 200 basis points of improvement from the second quarter.
We previously announced a $250 million share repurchase program.
We are particularly encouraged by the step-up in trends we saw in September, which outperformed our expectations and enabled us to achieve a new peak relative to 2019 RevPAR at 98%, driven primarily by the rebound in our urban markets.
Based on the current trends, we expect the incremental rate lift from 2019 to be nearly double our original underwriting and are very confident that we will exceed the 40% to 50% underwritten unlevered IRRs for each of these conversions.
Additionally, we continue to take advantage of the dislocation in our stock price by buying back incremental shares, bringing our total share repurchases to approximately 4.9 million shares so far this year.
