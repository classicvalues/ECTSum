Operating FFO per diluted share of $0.27 was flat versus last quarter despite the outsized bad debt expense related to Regal's bankruptcy filing in September.
Given the better-than-expected performance in the quarter, we are raising our operating FFO per share guidance to $1.02 to $1.05, up from $1.01 to $1.05, a $0.005 increase at the midpoint.
Our SNO backlog will provide earnings tailwind through 2025 with a total incremental benefit to operating FFO expected to be about $0.15 per share, up from $0.09 per share last quarter.
And lastly, today, we only have roughly 5% floating rate debt, limiting our downside risk to a rising rate environment.
We generated renewal lease spreads of 8.5% and 7.0% during the third quarter 2022 and on a trailing 12-month basis, respectively.
We expect $0.01 to come online in the fourth quarter of 2022, $0.08 in 2023, $0.05 in 2024 and $0.01 in 2025.
Liquidity is high, and we expect it to be about $475 million at the end of the year.
We have closed on about $225 million of acquisitions located primarily in Boston and Miami that were funded at a largely leverage and earnings neutral basis with asset sales in Chicago, Detroit and Columbus.
Today, we have no debt maturing until 2025, roughly 95% of our debt is fixed and we have a clear pathway to leverage in the low 6s as our signed not open, or SNO, commences.
Before turning the call over to Mike, I wanted to provide some additional color on 2 retailers that have been in the news as of late.
Our stores have a low average ABR per square foot of $11.59, which is about the lowest rent amongst our peers.
Today, we have roughly 14 active projects totaling $57 million that are expected to generate a weighted average return on cost of about 10%.
Of the $576,000 of bad debt that we recognized during the quarter, $557,000 was due to Regal.
Including our SNO balance of $14 million, this week's revolver paydown of $80 million and undrawn forward equity of $16 million, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA would be 6.0x.
Additionally, we are raising our same-property NOI growth assumption range to 3.75% to 4.25%, a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint.
This is on the heels of selling 2 assets located in Chicago and Detroit during the third quarter.
