For the third quarter, earnings available for distribution was $0.16 per share.
As was the case in the prior quarter, mark-to-market adjustments of negative $0.50 per share on our investment portfolio were the primary driver of our $0.44 per share GAAP loss for the quarter.
Redwood's GAAP book value declined to $10.18 per share at September 30th, a 5.6% decline from $10.78 per share at June 30th.
As Chris mentioned, our GAAP book value was $10.18 per share or 5.6% lower than $10.78 per share at the end of the second quarter.
We also declared and paid a $0.23 per share common stock dividend, which is unchanged from the previous quarter.
Consistent with evolving industry practices, we have reintroduced a non-GAAP measure to provide the market insight into our run rate operating and investing margins called earnings available for distribution or EAD, which was $0.16 per share in the third quarter as compared to negative $0.11 per share in Q2.
At September 30, our net undistributed loan inventory was $712 million, down 5% from the end of Q2.
Overall, we deployed $235 million of capital during the third quarter, largely split between organic BPL investments, third-party investments and the completion of the Riverbend acquisition in addition to the share repurchases that Chris referenced.
For starters, it means we're entitled to 100 cents on the dollar for assets we currently own at $0.69.
And in 2022, overall, we have now sold $3.7 billion of loans and continue to track the securitization market, notwithstanding the challenges that Chris referenced.
The abrupt move higher rates has impacted all corners of the financial markets and is perhaps now felt most acutely in residential mortgage volumes with some industry estimates pegging overall year-over-year activity down 50% or more.
We expect run rate operating expenses to decline another 5% to 10% from year-to-date annualized levels, as we head into 2023 and expect to further address our go-forward cost structure, as our outlook for 2023 continues to take shape.
The distribution of maturities is relatively smooth over the next 24 months, with only 35% having a contractual maturity within the next year.
This compares to a loss of $0.11 per share in the second quarter when applying this metric.
We've already expressed this view by repurchasing close to $60 million of common stock over the last 5 months, but we anticipate doing much more in the near to medium term and have ample capital to do so.
Our residential business remained conservatively positioned in the third quarter locking $461 million of jumbo loans, while distributing $612 million of loans, all through sales to 8 discrete whole loan buyers.
