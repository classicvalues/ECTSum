Net income was $66.1 million and earnings per share was $1.06.
Excluding those items, net income for the third quarter would have been $25.5 million, an increase of 40% versus the same period last year, and earnings per share was $0.41, 20% above the $0.34 we earned in the prior year period.
Continuing on Slide 8, let me detail our quarterly earnings results: Revenues were $71.7 million for the third quarter.
In the meantime, we'll work to highlight that while the contractual cash flows from our $6 billion ground lease portfolio are certainly impacted by higher discount rates for assets with a similar credit profile.
The third quarter was marked by 2 important events with opposite impacts on Safehold.
However, this does not take into account that our cash flows are not fixed and 95% of our portfolio has some form of inflation protection built in, thereby creating a positive correlation between portfolio cash flow and inflation.
The 6 institutional quality multifamily assets, which we originated during the period can be seen on the right side of this slide.
Slide 7 provides a snapshot of our portfolio growth for the quarter: We hit another milestone with our aggregate portfolio crossing the $6 billion threshold, ending the quarter at $6.1 billion, representing 18x growth since our IPO.
However, these metrics presume a 0% inflationary environment for the duration of our ground leases.
The current portfolio generates a cash yield of 3.3% and an annualized yield of 5.1%.
We provide an overview on our capital structure: At the end of the third quarter, we had $3.8 billion of debt comprised approximately $1.5 billion of non-recourse secured debt, $1.4 billion of unsecured notes and $272 million of our pro rata share of debt on ground leases, which we own in partnership.
On Slide 14, we present an update on estimated UCA: Including the sale of a ground lease during the quarter, the estimated value of all of the unrealized capital appreciation above our cost basis grew to an estimated $10.5 billion, a $597 million increase from our last update by the previous quarter, equating to an 80% compound annual growth rate since our IPO in 2017.
The new ground leases originated during the quarter generated a weighted average yield of 5.8%, assuming 0% inflation, which is approximately a 30 basis points higher than the 5.5% yield for the deals we closed in the second quarter, also with a 0% inflation assumption.
Our weighted average debt maturity is 24 years.
Additionally, we funded $48 million associated with prior ground lease commitments.
In addition, we had $630 million drawn on our unsecured revolver.
