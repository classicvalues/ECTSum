Third quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.97 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.04 from a mark-to-market in fair value publicly held securities.
Given our current view for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77 per share to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share compared to $11.44 last year.
Today, we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter.
Turning to our other platform investments in the third quarter contributed $0.17 in FFO per share as compared to $0.28 in the prior year period after cash distributions received.
For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect a request to limit yourself to 1 question.
Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter, and increased $0.05 despite the negative currency impact of $0.05, given the strength in the dollar.
We expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI.
Let me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter, and contributed $0.05 of growth driven by higher rental income.
Average base minimum rent increased for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80, an increase of 1.7% year-over-year.
TRG was $1,080 per foot, a 25% increase.
Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15% increase.
Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share.
So that's an increase of 13% at the bottom end of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint and an increase of $0.26 at the midpoint compared to our initial guidance for the year.
We believe the value of our investments in OPI is over $2 billion.
These positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok integration cost and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from our 2 value-oriented brands.
Occupancy ended third quarter, 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points compared to the second quarter.
