We were encouraged by our third quarter results, which reflect the ongoing improvement in our operating fundamentals, as same store RevPAR recapture was 95% of 2019 levels for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase from the second quarter and a new quarterly high for our portfolio.
The quarter was highlighted by a particularly strong September when both same store and comparable 2019 portfolio RevPAR recapture reached 98%.

We expect the midpoint of consolidated cash corporate G&A to be $21.5 million; interest expense, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs to be $60.5 million; Series E and Series F preferred dividends to be $15.9 million; Series Z preferred distributions to be $2.3 million; and pro rata capital expenditures to be $65 million.
However, September margins for both same store and comparable portfolios were 275 basis points and 240 basis points higher than 2019 levels, respectively, partially driven by property tax rebates.
For the third quarter, same store and comparable portfolio ADRs were approximately 4% higher than 2019, both of which represented an approximately 200 basis point improvement from the second quarter.
From a capital expenditure perspective, during the third quarter, on a consolidated basis, we invested approximately $24 million in our portfolio, bringing our year-to-date total to $49 million.
Pro forma hotel EBITDA for the third quarter was $61.1 million, a 24% increase from the third quarter of last year.
Preliminary October RevPAR of $130 for our comparable 92-hotel portfolio is another new pandemic era high and represents a 96% recapture to October of 2019.
Our same store and comparable hotel EBITDA margins were 120 basis points and 170 basis points below 2019 levels, respectively, which is in line with the second quarter margin differential despite lower nominal RevPARs.
Weekday ADR in our urban portfolio accelerated throughout the third quarter, finishing September a robust 9% above July and 17% higher than September of last year.
