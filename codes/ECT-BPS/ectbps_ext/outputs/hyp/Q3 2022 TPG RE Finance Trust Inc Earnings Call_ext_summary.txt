We earned $0.19 per share in the quarter for the quarter.
Book value per common share declined quarter-over-quarter by $1.75 to $14.28 from $16.03 due to the $132.3 million increase in our CECL reserve.
Diluted distributable earnings per share for the 3 quarters just ended covered our $0.24 per share quarterly dividend at a ratio of 1.1x.
From a liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with $571 million of total liquidity.
Our current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per common share generates an annualized yield of 6.7% to book value and 11.4% to yesterday's closing stock price of $8.44.
In the first 2 quarters of the year, TRTX deliberately reduced our investment activity and bolstered our liquidity as we anticipated the continued effects of tightening financial conditions on real estate debt and equity markets.
In management's judgment, this significant increase was warranted by the rapid and material weakening of the debt capital markets and the investment markets for office properties, which we have observed since we downgraded 8 office loans at the end of the first quarter of this year, and that pace is especially accelerated during the past 4 months.
We recorded a net increase in our CECL reserve of $132.3 million to $225.6 million.
First, changes to our CECL reserve, net interest margin and our return during the third quarter to being 100% interest rate sensitive on both sides of our balance sheet, our capital strategy, our leverage and our liquidity.
So as a result, as you think about our current portfolio, we -- over the past 12 months, we have nearly doubled our multifamily exposure to approximately 44% of the portfolio while reducing our office exposure 1/3 down to 28% of the total portfolio.
Our 2 CLOs with open reinvestment periods are extremely valuable to us.
In addition, in the past quarter, we received repayments totaling $371 million, 82% of which were office loans.
During the quarter, LIBOR surged to 3.14% from 1.79%.
As evidenced in our Q3 originations, which I'll speak about in a moment, we continue to diversify our funding away from the series CLO market while maintaining attractive blended cost of funds for the company at a spread of 200 basis points and an advance rate of 79%.
At quarter end, our weighted average rate floor was 0.85%, and the rate on our highest floor was 2.3%.
During the quarter, we extended the maturities of 1 credit facility.
