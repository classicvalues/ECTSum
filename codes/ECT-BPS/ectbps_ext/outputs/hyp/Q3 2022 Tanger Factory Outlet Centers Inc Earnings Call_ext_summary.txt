So the revised guidance implies $0.44 in the fourth quarter.
Can you just walk us down from $0.47 in the third quarter to that $0.44 midpoint just so we can get a sense of, I guess, the run rate heading into 2023, a little bit better to the extent if there's anything that we should be thinking about?
So as we continue to have 6 straight quarters of spread growth, we're taking advantage with a relatively low OCR of about 8.5% versus historical high OCRs pre-COVID, in the low double digits.
Or is it just -- I'm just trying to understand, you've got like the 76% of leasing completed versus for 2022 versus last year, where it was lower, but the expirations are higher.
I said historically, we were in the low double digits from an OCR point of view at 8.5.
Maybe provide further details on kind of what you're doing in those assets, what was driving that occupancy and now that you're sort of at that 96.5% range, which was much higher than I thought sequentially, kind of what the upside is here?
I would say probably in the past 4 or 5 years, there were fewer retailers.
And what we've found in years past, about 80% of our leases will renew this year.
We've got over $200 million of cash in short-term deposits.
So that is a component of the 160 basis points of sequential gain, but we have strong momentum on the permanent side and have continued to lock in long-term leases.
I keep on going back to 6 successive quarters of spread growth.
I guess first, for the 160 basis points in sequential lease rate pickup, can you give us a sense as to how much of that was permanent occupancy versus temp?
We've raised rents on permanent deals by $10 and TAs have gone up by the same $10.
We said in the past that temporary tenancy was over 10%.
So base rent was $71.7 million in Q2 and Q3.
And then curious if you have any thoughts specifically that you might be able to share around rue21, they represent 1.4% of your base rents, any expectations there?
