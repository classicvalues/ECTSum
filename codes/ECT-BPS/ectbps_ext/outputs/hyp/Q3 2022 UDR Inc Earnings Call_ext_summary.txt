Our third quarter FFO as adjusted per share of $0.60 achieved the high end of our previously provided guidance range and was driven by strong same-store revenue growth and further accretion from our 2021 acquisitions.
For the fourth quarter, our FFOA per share guidance range is $0.60 to $0.62 or a 2% sequential and 13% year-over-year increase of the midpoint.
We now anticipate full year FFOA per share of $2.32 to $2.34 with the $2.33 midpoint representing a $0.02 or 1% increase versus our prior full year guidance and a 16% increase versus full year 2021.
We now expect to achieve 2022 same-store revenue and NOI growth of 11.5% and 14.4% at the midpoint on a straight-line basis or an increase of 50 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively.
And New York City, where the burn-off of our 421 abatement continues.
To begin, strong sequential same-store revenue growth of 4.7%, drove year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 12.7% and 15.5% on a straight-line basis.
These results translated into 18% year-over-year growth in FFOA per share and drove our third quarter guidance raise this year, which Mike and Joe will discuss in further detail.
For the fourth quarter, we expect blended lease rate growth to average 6% to 7% with the sequential deceleration due to toughening year-over-year comps.
For October, blended lease rate growth is expected to be roughly 7% to 8%, comprised of new lease rate growth of 4.5% to 5% and renewals of approximately 10%.
Highlights of the third quarter include the following: sequential same-store revenue growth of nearly 5%; year-over-year, same-store revenue grew almost 13% and NOI was nearly 16% higher.
Finally, we are continuing to drive forward on innovation with the intent of further expanding our 325 basis point controllable operating margin advantage versus peers.
Initiatives underway are expected to generate roughly $40 million in incremental NOI by year-end 2025 and will be increasingly focused on revenue upside versus expense controls.
This was an acceleration of 150 and 110 basis points, respectively, compared to our second quarter results and were better than expected.
Our GRESB survey score of 87 was the highest in our history and an achievement that all UDR stakeholders should be proud of.
Combined, this negatively impacted R&M and A&M during the quarter by $1.6 million, which should generate approximately $7 million in incremental revenue over the next 12 months.
However, as we are typically reimbursed by residents for approximately 70% of this line item, same-store NOI was not meaningfully impacted.
