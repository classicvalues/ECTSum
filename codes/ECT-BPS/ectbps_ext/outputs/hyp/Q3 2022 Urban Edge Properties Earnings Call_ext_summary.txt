For full year 2022, we expect FFO as adjusted to range from $1.17 per share to $1.19 per share.
I am pleased to announce another strong quarter with FFO as adjusted of $0.30 per share, an 8% increase over the third quarter of last year and a 7% increase year-to-date.
First, in terms of our third quarter results, we had a very good quarter with FFO as adjusted of $0.30 per share, achieving same property NOI growth of 3.4% compared to the third quarter of last year or 1.5% when including properties and redevelopment.
We look forward to seeing other new anchor stores open in the coming quarters, including Shoprite and Marshalls at Huntington, Sector 66 at Las Catalinas, Nemours Children's Health at (inaudible) and Ralph's Grocery Store and Walgreens at Montehiedra.
Details can be found on Page 22 of our supplement.
We have updated our disclosure related to the timing of the signed but not open pipeline, highlighting that we expect about $600,000 in Q4 of this year with an additional $10.9 million coming next year.
Overall leasing spreads this quarter were negative 1.1%.
Just in the past year, we have increased our occupancy from 93% to 95%, a notable growth rate following the pandemic.
Regarding Bed Bath & Beyond, we learned that 1 location we have with an early 2023 exploration will not be renewed and we are actively in the market talking to potential replacements.
We currently have $261 million of active redevelopment projects underway and expect to generate a 10% unlevered return on this investment.
Looking at our receivables, we expect only minimal collections during 2023 on accounts previously deemed uncollectible as we now believe that the bulk of collections we were estimating have been realized, including another $1 million to $2 million, which we are expecting in the fourth quarter of this year.
Based on our mortgages maturing next year and the unhedged portion of variable rate debt, we expect interest expense on in-place debt will increase $10 million to $11 million next year, considering the current SOFR Curve.
This is up from $23 million we reported last quarter and reflects $7.3 million of new rents from recently executed leases, including Target at Bruckner, while $1.8 million of rents commenced during the period, resulting in a net increase of $5.5 million.
We have minimal and very manageable maturities in 2024 and 2025, amounting to 144 and $52 million, respectively.
In terms of our balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the quarter with total cash of $152 million and have no amounts drawn on our recently expanded and recast $800 million line of credit, which has a new maturity date of February 2027.
The store looks great, and we are excited to reactivate 134,000 square feet of space that has been vacant for almost 2 years.
