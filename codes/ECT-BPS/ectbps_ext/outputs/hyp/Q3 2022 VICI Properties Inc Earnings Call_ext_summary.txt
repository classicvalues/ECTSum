AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022, is expected to be between $1.682 billion and $1.692 billion or between $1.91 and $1.92 per diluted common share.
AFFO for the third quarter was approximately $471 million or $0.49 per share.
In terms of VICI's liquidity and balance sheet, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $726 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $490 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our outstanding forward sale agreements, $2.5 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw term loan.
The key benefits realized in Q3 2022 included growing our revenue by 100% versus the same quarter in 2021, manifesting the full impact of our acquisitions of the Venetian and MGP; growing our AFFO by 83% year-over-year; growing AFFO per share by 8.5% year-over-year; announcing a dividend increase of 8.3%, giving VICI a dividend compound annual growth rate of 8.2% since our emergence in October 2017.
Our key growth activities in Q3 and early Q4 included announcing an additional $186 million of financings within our partnership with Great Wolf Resorts, announcing our $203.9 million acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort, announcing a $200 million real estate financing partnership with Canyon Ranch.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our prorata share of the BREIT JV debt.
We're excited about expanding our relationship with Century as we've witnessed their relentless operating focus firsthand since we jointly acquired 3 regional assets in 2019.
We wholeheartedly believe that our track record, which includes over $30 billion of transaction speaks to our relentless focus and dedication to create long-term value for our shareholders.
We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.9 years to maturity.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction, is approximately 5.8x.
Our G&A was $12.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.
Given our relationship with Century, we were able to leverage our existing master lease and our combined cost of capital to structure a transaction that work for all 3 parties involved, that being VICI, Century and Golden Entertainment, the seller of the asset.
During the quarter, we sold approximately 3.9 million shares with an aggregate value of $135 million after fees under our ATM program.
So even in an environment where the 10-year treasury rate is north of 4%, a rate that many younger investors have never seen in their lifetime, VICI is focused on maintaining discipline in everything we pursue.
As John mentioned, VICI turned 5 years old on October 6.
Upon closing, rent under our master lease with Century will increase by $15.5 million, representing a 7.6% acquisition cap rate.
