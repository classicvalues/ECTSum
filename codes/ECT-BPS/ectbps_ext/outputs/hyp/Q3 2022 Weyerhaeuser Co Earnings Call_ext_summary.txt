Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $310 million or $0.42 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion.
That said, our fourth quarter outlook includes work stoppage impacts through October, followed by a 7- to 10-day ramp-up period to return to full operating capacity.
Key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18.
We currently expect to ramp up to full operating posture over 7 to 10 days after returning to work.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $583 million in the third quarter.
As shown on Page 20, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are moderately lower than the third quarter averages.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $94 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter.
I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides.
Timberlands contributed $107 million to third quarter earnings.
We continue to anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 35% to 40% for the full year.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million lower than the second quarter, largely driven by the decrease in lumber and OSB pricing during the quarter.
I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15.
As a result, we anticipate share repurchase will represent a larger portion of our 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD cash return this year.
We ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion.
Adjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $468 million, as highlighted on Page 17, and we have generated approximately $2.4 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date.
And as of quarter end, we had $523 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program.
