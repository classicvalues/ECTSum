The third quarter property-level portfolio information we'll be speaking about today is on a same-property basis for 32 hotels.
Overall demand accelerated in September, with RevPAR growth of 2.7% as compared to 2019, marking a reversal from modest RevPAR declines in July and August, driven by improved occupancy that significantly closed the gap to 2019 as compared to prior months.
For the third quarter, our 32 same-property portfolio RevPAR was $159.06 based on occupancy of 64.2% and an average data rate of $247.74.
We also entered into an agreement to sell Kimpton Hotel Monaco, Denver for $69.75 million or approximately $369,000 per key.
Relative to prior guidance, our current outlook is $2 million lower on the bottom end and $22 million lower on the top end.
Same-property hotel EBITDA of $52.2 million represented an increase of 1.4% from the third quarter of 2019, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth relative to 2019.
As such, our same-property RevPAR guidance is unchanged from prior guidance at down 5% versus 2019 at the midpoint.
Third quarter same-property hotel EBITDA was $52.2 million, an increase of 1.4% on a total revenue decline of 0.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019, resulting in 48 basis points of margin improvement.
